Title: Ongoing back and neck pain.

Author: the patient
Story: After years of Physiotherapists, Osteopaths, Acupuncture, Massage therapists & Nurafun, I asked my doctor to refer me to a muscular skeletal specialist. I thought there must be an answer to the ongoing pain & discomfort & hoped a specialist practitioner could help. The treatment involved more anti inflammatory medication & anesthetic injections into the local area of pain. I thought I would be in for a more specialist/proactive treatment & consequently did not return. I didn't feel inclined to pursue this situation with my GP in case he was offended at the feedback aimed at his colleague. So back to massage & physio & stretches & exercises thanks to the excellent help from my local Physio who seems to listen well & ask the right questions & can always put his hand on the exact location of the pain or injury just by "listening" to me complain. I guess the moral of my story is I will always return to the listener as the first alternative rather than risk prescription of more drugs & then counter drugs for damage control.

Story: Wife fell and knocked herself out in the middle of the night and starting convulsing. Once she came round took her to mater public emergency at around 1am. It took 1.5hrs before we actually got a bed and someone examined her. They then said they will have to do a scan before they release her. 7 hrs later scan was done. 3hrs later finally released. That is just not good enough, I think if it had been serious after 10hrs she could have been dead. My mistake for going to public in middle of night instead of private.

Story: I recently visited the local GP about renewing a prescription and a general check up. The GP was very informative in regards to my options and explained the pros and cons of each different prescription. Although it was my first appointment with this particular doctor I felt that she really cared about what suited me and provided me with more than enough information in answer to all of my questions.

Title: Broken elbow treated at Redcliffe Hospital.
Time: 2012-02-22T22:44:06Z
Location: Redcliffe Hospital / Radiology;
Author: the patient
Story: I attended Redcliffe Hospital after falling off a bicycle with a dislocated elbow. When I arrived the nurses I saw seemed to see I was in a lot of pain and sent me straight through for an x-ray to see what damage had been done. The radiologist was very abrupt, rude and unsympathetic and told me to straighten my elbow so that he could take pictures properly. As I was in a lot of pain I tried my best but was unable to straighten my elbow as it was obviously out of shape. He seemed to get very frustrated with me and said that this was the best that he could do. Not surprisingly the xrays did not reveal any breaks but showed dislocation. My arm was placed in a plaster on a 90 degree angle and I was sent home. 4 weeks later the plaster was taken off and I was unable to bend my arm. It remained at the 90 degree angle no matter how much I tried to straighten it. I returned to Redcliffe Hospital and was told to just straighten it and it was psychological, that if I wanted me straighten my arm I could. I was absolutely shattered to be dismissed like that. After consulting an Orthopeadic Surgeon, I was told that I would need extensive OT to straighten my arm as it was misdiagnosed and should never have been put in plaster. I, did in fact, have a broken elbow and should have had surgery to fix it. As some months had passed since my initial visit to the hospital there was now no chance of proper healing and it isn't a viable option to now go into surgery. 12 months later, numerous OT sessions, and major out of pocket expenses, I still can't fully straighten my elbow and according to the Orthopeadic Surgeon most likely never will. This could all have been avoided if a certain radiologist showed some empathy and understanding and listened to a woman who was trying to tell him that she could not straighten her arm and was in a lot of pain instead of treating her with disdain and contempt.

Story: I was a little worried when I checked my phone to see there was a missed call from my local GP clinic, where I visited last week for a general check-up. I immediately started to worry that something was wrong. My only thought was that my test results were in and something was wrong, why else would they be calling me. However, after listening to the voice message left by my doctor, I realised she was just calling to let me know that my results were fine. I was so surprised that the doctor actually called me. I thought the doctor only called if something was wrong or they don't call at all, which has been my experience in the past. I am always told to call for the results. I found this to be a very nice touch, taking time out of her busy day to call me and let me know my results were fine. Thank you Dr C ï?Š

Title: Horrible ER experience at Mater Emergency (Brisbane) for Chronic Neck Pain Sufferer
Time: 2012-02-24T09:31:11Z
Location: Mater Adult Hospital / Accident & emergency;
Author: the patient
Story: Last weekend I arrived in the Mater Hospital Emergency Dept suffering from extreme neck pain. I have a neck injury from a car accident I was involved in. I have had chronic pain in my neck since the car accident. I had recently had surgery on my neck (facet joint injections and nuerotomy). Unfortunately I have ended up with an over-stimulisation of my nerves and have incredible pain in my neck as a result. It is a side effect of nuerotomy and is expected to resolve itself within 6 weeks. This was the first time I had ever turned up to emergency for strong painkillers and I have been suffering from this debilitating neck condition since the accident. I was in a really bad way, both physically and mentally, when I presented at emergency on this particular morning and tried my best to describe the position I was in. Not only did the doctor I saw appear to be condescending and rude to me, she did not seem to try to understand what procedure I had done. I specifically told her that a certain painkiller was not strong enough (as I had been taking it at home) and that I desperately needed a stronger drug to give me some relief from this unrelenting pain I was experiencing. I felt the response and treatment that I received was beyond disgusting. I had a splitting headache, it felt like someone was taking to my head with an axe and I was visibly very uncomfortable. I was curled up on a chair with my hands over my eyes, rocking back and forth, with tears running down my face. The doctor asked a few questions about why I was there and in between the tears I told her what my symptoms were and the procedure I had and then told her I desperately need relief from this pain with stronger drugs than what I had been taking. They gave me 2 of the pills I had been taking at home (the ones that were not strong enough), given an anti-inflammatory injection, sent back to sit in a waiting room chair and then sent home with a script for 4 of the same pills and told to go and see my GP. So I ended up leaving the hospital in pretty much the same condition that I had arrived and totally disheartened in our health system. Now I understand that there are some people out there who may try to fool people into giving them strong painkillers that they don't actually need, and this is how the doctor made me feel. Not that I felt she had any reason to think this as I had no history of presenting at emergency and asking for strong painkillers and she had records of my car accident in my file as I attended Mater Emergency that night. I was a real person, in real pain and to be fobbed off like I was at the hospital that morning was damaging to my emotional well being as well as my physical. It is an incredibly hard road to travel, when you have chronic pain, and to be treated the way I was, is appalling. And to add to my experience, I called to make a complaint only to be made to leave a message that to my knowledge has not been returned. Thankfully I saw a GP at my clinic the next morning who was more than happy to sit down and work through my options of painkillers and come up with a plan for me to get through the next few weeks.

Story: I had months of constant abdominal pain and vomiting, losing weigh but I got told my symptoms where due to stress after a marriage breakdown. GP sent me to a Psychiatrist - who seemed to think there was nothing mentally wrong. I had to constantly ask for tests to find out what the problem was - couldn't get a referral to a specialist. Finally I got so sick I ended up in Emergency with about the 5th bowel obstruction in 12 months - off to surgery and I ended up with bowel resection due to Crohns disease that had caused a stricture that had closed the bowel down so nothing got thru. I got to 45 kgs. This was not good. I would urge GPs to please consider referring your patient to a Gastroenterologist if they are experiencing ongoing abdo pain, nausea & vomiting - so they can get a diagnosis and medication as soon as possible.

Story: I was forced off the road during a recreational ride in the Beechmont area in the Gold Coast hinterland. I awoke to the ministrations of an Ambulance Officer, was able to walk to the ambulance, and was transported to the Pindara Private Hospital. The quality of care I received was professional and thorough (as one would expect from a private hospital). I spent the next three months off work in a painful recovery/rehabilitation. The majority of my post accident care was administered in the public health system at Logan Hospital, referred there by my GP who believed the fracture clinic was the best place to attend for expert care and advice. Although the waits were sometimes long, I found the care I received to be excellent, although it seemed somewhat cautious on the issue of plating the fracture due to the "risks" of surgery in that area of the body. More than a year after the accident, I'm largely functional again but the fracture has not healed and is still flexible. (I notice that Molly Meldrum was able to have his clavicle fracture repaired, thus leading to a much quicker healing process.)

Story: I took my elderly mother to the Eye and Ear Hospital for regular treatment for macular degeneration. A part from the waiting time, which was unacceptable (just about always over 3 hours), the medico performing the procedure appeared to be using Betadine. Apparently it is commonly used as part of the treatment procedure, however my mother is allergic to it. She was very distressed because she made a concerted effort to alert the doctor and the medico performing the procedure. The doctor highlighted the file note and advised mum to let the medico know before the procedure began â€“ which she did. Unfortunately, the medico seemed to have grabbed the Betadine and applied it to her eye. Fortunately the mistake was realised and her eye was flushed. My mother was very distressed by these events because it is not the first time it has happened. For her the distress is so great that she has become very anxious about attending the hospital for treatment

We drove her to the hospital and I could hear wheezing from the front seat, We waited at triage and after we had given her details. we were called into a little examination room. She was examined and then we were sent back to the Waiting room. About twenty minutes later, we were called again where we were taken to a bed. The doctor then examined her and informed me there was no wheeze and she was fine, I noticed one of the nurses seemed to be shooting me looks. When the doctor left- the nurse told me she had already noted down that she could hear the wheeze in my daughter's chest while we were at Triage. The doctor came back and the nurse and she had a little conference and then they came back and informed me they would give my two year old Ventolin. About 40 minutes later they came back and gave her Ventolin and then listened to her chest again... My daughter started to improve almost immediately. We were then ignored for another 2 hours until another doctor came in to check her again. We were then told we could go home as soon as they had organized some antibiotics and ventolin. An hour and a half later the original doctor and the original nurse returned with a spacer, Ventolin and antibiotics. The doctor then started to outline the treatment and strangely, it appeared, would look at the nurse for confirmation.

Story: During a period of about a week my 90yr old mother was forced to attend a Radiology practice on 3 separate occasions as the radiologist was not allowed to perform more than one examination on a day. In order to have an MRI, a CT scan and an ultra sound she had to attend on 3 seperate occasions. The first procedure showed a cyst which she perceived as a tumour or cancer as no one seemed to explain the result to her adequately. She was attempting to be independent and cope alone without telling or bothering her family so drove herself for the appointments. The weather at the time was exceptionally hot and she uses oxygen for her breathlessness which always becomes worse with stress. Staff at the radiology practice assisted her to her car and were concerned about her condition and tried to discourage her from driving herself home but she insisted and fortunately got home safely (the radiology staff even phoned to check that she got home safely â€“ congratulation to those caring people for this small gesture of care). My mother ended up being admitted to hospital by ambulance 2 days later as she was still so stressed and extremely breathless. My son and sister have also had similar problems having to return on multiple occasions for radiological examinations due to this restriction of not allowing more than one procedure per day. I am concerned that this rule could be creating great inconvenience and excessive cost to the community. It is hard to imagine the reason â€“ maybe to stop the Doctor over prescribing examinations? â€“ if so it does not seem to be working and only appears to be causing much inconvenience and cost to individual patients who have to take extra time off work and make additional trips for the procedures.

Story: I had a backslab on my right arm replaced with a waterproof cast. The nurse did outline a few issues with waterproof casts including not using creams etc and said I would get an information sheet. Unfortunately I was not given an information sheet and it was not made clear to me that the nurse didnâ€™t just mean "don't put creams inside the cast". Using my right hand to apply a hydrocortisone cream to my body every day and then washing my hands caused the cream to get washed inside the cast and my hand and arm blistered badly after about 4 days. I think patients need to get an information sheet and also it needs to be made clear that if you want to have a waterproof cast on your arm you should not only avoid putting creams inside it but also do not use that hand to apply creams or apply creams above or below the cast.

Story: Following a low anterior resection I was in hospital and restricted diet post op. Each day as I got better the restricted diet became frustrating and the sight of yellow jelly was becoming obnoxious. I still wasn't allowed to eat solids until things started to work. There was a lovely young girl who came around with tea and meals each day whoappeared just as hopeful as myself each day that I would be able to eat something different. She always came in my room with what seemed like a hopeful expectant look. The day I finally got the yes when she arrived at morning tea she beamed with a lovely smile when I said I could eat something and then produced a special piece of buttered fruit bun she had tucked away instead of the dry biscuits that were going around. I just wanted to say that whilst I believe the clinical staff, doctors, nurses, allied health etc are heroes, I think the non clinical staff like these lovely people can make an enormous difference to patients recovery. It is often the little things such as this very kind act that can make such a difference to a patient's mental outlook in recovery. The catering, clerical and wards people can make a big difference to patients too and are often not perceived to be valued for this contribution to healthcare. I bet there are millions of stories like mine that go untold and staff like this girl who go unnoticed. So here I am telling about these little touches (I was a patient at St Vincents hospital Lismore) I have come accross other staff in roles throughout the public and private hospitals I have been in over the cancer journey and they are some exceptionally caring and cheering people.

Story: I had unexplained reduction in haemoglobin levels from normal to 9.5, symptoms being pink urine and general lethargy. I had just been made redundant, effective about 6 weeks later, after I came back from a field trip to Darwin (hotter and more humid than Melbourne) and thought my lethargy was due to the heat, and preparing for retirement. I am taking Ritalin for ADD, so increased the dose a little. Only on return I found I had pink urine; blood tests showed haemoglobin at 9.5, and a week later 8.5. Many blood tests, X-rays and a bone marrow biopsy later nothing could be found and I had a diagnosis of Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia. I was prescribed Prednisolone (a very high dose), which cured it completely, within a few weeks. After a month or so, the dose was halved and halved every month thereafter, cutting out after a year. I was not made aware of the possibility of getting diabetes as a result of taking the medication. I was overweight and my diet was not ideal. I think it would have been nice if the doctor seeing me had made clear to me the possible side-effects, stressing the importance of diet and exercise as a way to reduce the risk of getting diabetes. But if told, I may not have had the capacity early on, to exercise due to lethargy. And while I was taking prednisolone, it elevated my mood, making diet and exercise seem less important to me. I may have needed lots of encouragement early, to avoid diabetes.

Author: the patient
Story: Whilst holidaying in Hobart I was struck down with a severe migraine and uncontrollable vomiting. These attacks occur once every few months and always in the early hours of the morning. At home in Cairns I am able to attend the local 24 hour medical centre where I'm treated with Maxalon and Tramidol injections which provide almost immediate relief and I'm normally able to return home within an hour of the treatment and sleep it off. I understand Hobart doesn't have a 24 hour medical centre so I had no option but to go to the ER at RHH at around 3am in the morning. I was admitted almost immediately as I was vomiting uncontrollably in the reception area.... The nurses I saw were very caring and responsive. I was seen quite quickly by a Doctor and I explained my predicament and also let him know it's something I've experienced many times and also that Maxalon/Tramidol treatment was always very successful for me. He basically seemed to ignored this and told the nurse to give me intravenous Largactil and Maxalon. To me this meant a long stay and higher risk of infection by having a canula inserted in my arm. The Maxalon settled my nausea and the Largactil knocked me out but only appeared to have had a minor effect on the migraine headache. After a few hours I started to have a very strange and uncomfortable reaction where my I couldn't control my arms and legs and couldn't stop their repetitive involuntary flexing and unflexing. I told the nurse who must have gone to talk the doctor. Eventually I was taken off the IV and the problem subsided. After being there for approx. 8 hours, in out of consciousness, I seemed to be judged OK to leave. It took me another 24 hours before I felt normal again. I mentioned the severe reaction to the nurse at RHH, which I attributed to the Largactil and was told that it wasn't and that it would have been the Maxalon. Even after I stated that I have had Maxalon for years and never had this experience. I like to think I'm an articulate person with a better than average grasp of my condition. I wish I knew the secret though to getting the doctor to listen. My visit to the the RHH really seemed to take up so many more resources than I believe it had to. I believe if the doctor could have deigned to follow my regular protocol I could have been out of there in an hour or so rather than using, what I discovered post ER visit, what appeared to be the anti-psychotic drug Largactil off label and being turned into what I describe as a twitching zombie for 8 hours.

After only one visit he seemed to be cured of his phobia (that was a few years ago but he continues, to this day, to be a loyal patient). No matter how many times my husband had asked his previous dentists to let him know exactly what was about to happen (down to the tiniest little thing), the dentist seemed to refused this one thing which appeared to turned him from a crying, shivering wreck to someone who will go pretty much without even coaxing from me. A small but very important miracle I felt but why should this be so?

Story: I have a small fracture & I was referred to a specialist. No introduction, no pleasantries. I had to ask him to show me where the fracture was on the xray which he seemed to do with poor grace! There was no discussion about any relief or simple remedies. I was told surgery was one option. I had to ask what surgery entailed and was told screws, plate,and a piece of bone out of my hip. I replied I had only recently had an operation and really didn't fancy jeopardising that very successful procedure with possible infection complications etc. end of consult. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes with a very large gap after Medicare and feeling very let down and annoyed. When I related my experience to the GP clinic that referred me they said they had stopped referring patients to this doctor because of the negative feed back they were getting. I don't think that is good enough!

Story: From the word go, the whole process was fantastic!! Being birth number two and the first delivery experience horrendous we were both very anxious. However, from the word go the delivery went smoothly along with spending time in the birth suite to bond with the baby instead of being told they need that bed. I can't recommend a more highly professional team of health professionals. Funny enough, out of all my Midwives none had children of their own. And never once did I hear-"With my experience, you need to do it this way or breast is best." Congratulations to the North West Hospital-Burnie Tasmania and their fabulous health care professionals!!!

All the health care professionals I had contact with were extremely professional, supportive and showed great empathy. I thought the surgical team lead by Dr Steven were amazing, caring, kind and not the least bit patronizing. The accommodation, facilities, catering and housekeeping that I saw were all of a very high standard. In my opinion it is indeed a very special place where patients are treated as individuals and very well cared for.

Author: a carer
Story: My child, who has a serious mental illness, was discharged from Beenleigh Mental Health Service last year and referred to a GP (also my GP). I made an appointment to see the GP to discuss this matter and she expressed reservations about having enough expertise to take on the mental health care of my child. I was told she had not been asked by the mental health service if she would be willing to take this on. She had only been sent a letter saying that my child was now in her care. Before my child was discharged from the mental health service I had been assured by the treating doctor that any decisions regarding my child's discharge would be discussed with us. This did not happen and we still do not know who actually discharged my child. Recently my child experienced severe vomiting and was treated at Logan Hospital Emergency department. The doctor there could find no reason for the vomiting but suggested that it could be a side-effect of the anti-psychotic medication my child was taking. My child went to the GP to get the medication changed. The GP did not feel confident in prescribing a new medication and instead referred my child to a private psychiatrist who subsequently changed the medication. I am very concerned with the method that Beenleigh Mental Health Service discharges their patients. There does not seem to be proper consultation with the treating GP prior to the discharge or a consultation with the patient and their carer. The medication (fortnightly injection) my child was prescribed before discharged did not seem effective in treating the symptoms and my child had been hospitalised with severe psychotic symptoms while on this medication previously, so in my opnion my child was definitely not stabilised. I am also concerned that other patients are being discharged before they are properly stabilised and sent off to a GP who may or may not have enough knowledge to be able to treat them.

Story: Presented at Emergency with my partner who had a profusely bleeding deep wound to his forehead. The person at the desk did not triage the injury, or ascertain how it occurred, or how urgent the attention was needed. it seemed the first procedure was to ask us to fill out forms to say we could pay the fees. I asked for a dressing to stop the bleeding and my partner was handed a box of tissues! I said this was not enough (he had blood running down his arm) and she said we can't have that type of dressing out here. After being told we would have to wait more then half an hour (I had to ask) we left and went to a public hospital. I was disgusted at the lack of care we received and level of professionalism of the staff we saw. If a hospital says they have an emergency department then I think it needs to run as a functional ER not a pretend version where it appears they cannot really handle emergencies.

Story: I had a wonderful experience with the Royal Women's Hospital and it's great to be able to credit the staff, that I came into contact with, who were so kind, caring and professional. I had a baby at the Women's and was lucky enough to be a part of the Cosmos program. At the time the program was in the last stages of a trial, and it has now become a standard part of the Royal Women's public health services. The program assigns a midwife to each patient to see them through the pregnancy and birth of their child. The aim of the program is to assist women in having healthy births through continuity of care and availability of one midwife (of a team of three) for one-to-one care during pregnancy and labour. Women in the program are able to call their midwife when they go into labour, no matter the hour, and their midwives are able to help them by phone, assisting them to stay at home longer rather than go into hospital too early which can lengthen or even stop labour. When patients are ready to go to hospital, their midwives meet them there and deliver the baby. This continuity of care gave me peace of mind about the birth, because throughout the pregnancy I developed a great relationship and sense of trust with my midwife. She supported all of my and my partner's wishes for the birth plan and did not scoff at it (as many other health professionals do, because so much can happen that's not planned for), rather encouraged us to use a plan and suggested books for us to read that suited our philosophies. Her encouragement and support meant a great deal to my partner and I, and she helped us immeasurably with the birth. We spoke to her at 12am and 3am in the morning, and she met us at the Women's at 5am when we went in. The dedication of these midwives is remarkable. They make themselves available at such ungodly hours and our midwife had such a calm, professional and kind manner, she made us feel completely at ease throughout the whole process. We can't thank her or the other wonderful staff we saw at The Royal Women's Hospital enough!

Story: I write as I am disgruntled by my assessment and birth triage experience at a reputable tertiary hospital in Melbourne. For me this system was not a positive one and I did not feel it was conducive to remaining positive and in control for labour and delivery. On arrival at the hospital I was whisked into the emergency assessment area, where I was shut into what seemed like a tiny room while I was 'admitted' to the hospital. Then I was taken to a birth triage area. I thought 'what a violation of privacy!'. In my opinion it's just what every woman needs in labour - to feel like she must respect the women around her and feel uncomfortable for however long it takes to be assessed. For me, that was more than half an hour. I was in control and in a good headspace on arrival and then I was, in my opinion, forced to pace a curtained off stall with no room to move between bed, chairs, equipment and remain comfortable. To me this is not acceptable. I was happy with the care I received once in the birth suite and I felt the postnatal care was excellent (except the few times I was left too long with painkillers!).

Story: I was experiencing bleeding during my pregnancy and reported to the ED. I was seen after waiting 3 hours and was told that my baby was ok and an appointment was made in the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit for the following week. I was discharged. On the trip home, my bleeding increased significantly and I made the decision to return to the ED. On returning, the Nurse caring for me sighted the loss and suggested that my waters may have broken. I saw the Dr who asked me what I wanted them to do. I requested an ultrasound but was refused as it wasn't perceived as a life or death situation. I requested the earlier loss be sighted as I was aware of the significance if my waters had in fact broken. The matter was not investigated any further. I was sent home without any further action. 4 days later, I developed an acute uterine infection and my baby was stillborn at 16 weeks 3 days. It is my belief that this infection may have been prevented had proper investigations been done regarding the rupture of my membranes.

Story: I had fantastic one on one care with a private midwife for my pre natal care, my labour and birth and my post natal care. I had a second midwife as back up and a transfer plan with my local public hospital (Hornsby Hospital) . My GP also provided the prescriptions required for birth and the baby. The care from my GP and midwives was fantastic and I would not change a thing. My vaginal birth after caesarean was quick, easy and inspiring, and at home. The only thing I would change was the onus on the hospital midwife and obstetrician I saw to officially advise me against birthing at home. Unofficially both wished me well and said I should expect a good outcome. So why the need for an 'official' line that seemed to have no consideration for my individual situation?

The one-on-one continued care of the midwife assigned to me for the duration of my pregnancy, the birth and the post natal care was, in my view, outstanding. Unfortunately this time the collaboratve arrangements meant that an obstetrician over-ruled home birth the day I went into labour for reasons that turned out to be false/un-founded. My midwife showed exemplary levels of commitment to safety, and exemplary level of skill. I would recommend this service to any family that is willing to inform themselves and would like the opportunity to have, what I believe to be a most fulfilling and empowering experience. Was I disappointed that I did not birth at home? Yes. Did I still have a wonderful birth experience with my midwife right along side me in the hospital? Yes. Would I recommend this service? Yes absolutely.

Story: My son was born at 35 weeks, 6 weeks after being on bed rest in hospital for 8 weeks with complete placenta previa. I had a general anaesthetic for the C-section and woke up feeling very groggy and panicked not knowing what had happened to my son. Thankfully, the anaesthetist had met with me earlier and knew exactly the answers I'd want to know, he informed me my son was in NICU but was doing okay. Then they took me in to see him. Up on the ward the midwives I saw would not allow me to have my doula in the room when they would give me any information, despite me begging them to allow her to stay. They claimed confidentiality reasons, but I wanted someone with me because I wouldn't remember what they were saying as I was on high doses of morphine, days later when I asked questions they appeared to get annoyed with me because I should have been told on the first day, but I just did not remember. Booklets of information were placed on shelves up high (I'm 5'3") and I only discovered them when I was packing up to go home. I asked for the morphine drip to be taken out as it was making me feel sick and unable to stay awake and met with great opposition. I felt I had to get very angry for anyone to listen to me. After 2 hours of asking a doctor came and disconnected it. I wanted to take a shower and to get into a wheelchair to be able to go to see my son. I was told that they were far too busy and I would have to wait. So I got my doula to help me into the shower. A midwife then proceeded to force her way into the bathroom slamming the door into my doulas back. She demanded to know what we were doing and why I was showering without her permission. She demanded to see my pad and how much loss I had. After a few minutes of me demanding for her to leave she finally did. My doula had to search for a wheelchair and then we were finally off to NICU. My son was on CPAP so I couldn't hold him.We went back up to the ward and I hand expressed some colostrum, the NICU nurse told me the midwives would help me but I could not see one around. My doula went home and another friend came to stay the night, she helped me into the wheelchair and we went to NICU for my first cuddle and feed with my son. We then went back to the ward. There were so many other babies crying and I got a bit emotional while expressing, the midwife told me not to bother with that if I'm not going to get much. This was less then 24 hours after birth in a breastfeeding friendly hospital. That night I was told a NICU staff member would call when he woke, I did not receive a call. We'd get to NICU to find that he was asleep again and I wasn't allowed to hold him. The next day and night I would go down every 3 hours for feeds. I was questioned by the pain team as to why I wanted the morphine out and why I was only taking panadol. A midwife came to take my OBs and that was it. Day 3-5 were pretty uneventful. On day 5 a registrar came into my room and asked quite loudly where my baby was. When I said HDU she asked what had happened. I said he had been there since birth and she looked confused. I couldn't believe it. She had been at the birth! My doula visited us often and was a great support to me. A midwife questioned whether I had a mental disability requiring her to be there, I don't, and a social worker asked if I could do anything without her. I was determined to breastfeed but was told by a NICU nurse that breastfed babies were a pain because they can't be scheduled. I wanted to few on demand but was told that wasn't how things were done and besides demand fed babies don't gain weight. He didn't appear to gain much weight on their schedule but he tripled his birth weight when we came home and demand fed. On day 5 he was moved into an open air cot. At some point he wet himself and it leaked through, he was left in his wet nappy so long that his temperature dropped and he had to go back into the humicrib, which was, in my eyes, a major setback. I was discharged that same day and was lucky that one of the hostel beds was free or I would have gone home without my baby. This is a fantastic service but I think there should be more support for mothers discharging without their babies. For the most part, the nurses looking after my son were great .As he got healthier and closely to SCN they were even better. It seems to me the ICU nurses that I came into contact with (bar one we saw who was brilliant) seemed quite cold and detached. Finally on the 7th day he was discharged but we had to wait 3 hours to have his hearing test done. There weren't any birth registration packs available, they told us we could wait a month but we were moving interstate the following week. We had a follow up visit and found the nurse to be very rude. She wanted to see our bath, the babies sleeping area, our toddlers sleeping area (forget that she was napping at the time) and she appeared to get very annoyed when I told her we had no sterilizing equipment because we weren't using a dummy or bottles. Again I was feeling pressure to use formula even though he was gaining weight steadily on breastfeeding alone. I refused another visit. All in all, although there were several midwives who I thought were good (especially on the ante-natal ward) and the nurses I saw in HDU were great there was many things that happened to both of us that I donâ€™t think should have ever happened to anyone.

Story: 14 months ago I gave birth to my son via C-section. He was delivered at the Mater Hospital, Sydney. I can honestly not say enough good things about my experience. All the MW's, nurses and doctors I saw were amazing. I wanted to pretty much be left alone and that was what they did - checking on me occasionally to make sure all was fine While I was in hospital a mum came back in with PND and she became psychotic over the next 24 hours. I was in the room next to her and it was very scary listening to her pain at 3am in the morning, especially as a new mum with a newborn. When I went to talk to the staff in tears, they were wonderful. Found another room for me for the night, made sure I was ok. I do think there can still be more education around breastfeeding with some staff. In my opinion it is not good to shove a baby on a mum's boob. I think there should be more education around a gentle parenting approach, teaching mum's to follow their instincts. I also believe that in the classes I did after birth, that we should discuss what you should do when your baby gets a temperature for the first time. How to handle it rather than medicating straight away.

He saw the doctor within 20 minutes and received 13 stitches in his forehead and a tetanus injection. We were seen, treated and went home from the hospital within 2 hours. We were both impressed with the level of professionalism, care and actions of staff who came into contact with us.

Story: I am a 74 year old lady living alone, using a crutch to save from falling, due to long standing spinal damage. I had a fall (believe I may have been attacked) coming home. Unable to get up, after 2 hours managed to get the attention of a passer by, to get an ambulance. Badly damaged cut face, broken and loose teeth, various bruises etc etc. (Also the glutumous minus was torn from the bone and the minimus tendon damaged, but not diagnosed at the time). The staff I saw at the Swan District Hospital were extremely carefull to eliminate brain damage, stroke or heart attack. I was told someone from the ACAD team would follow up on the Monday after discharge on Friday, as some funding for help would be needed. Nothing happened, as I live on the wrong side of the street and the district dividing line goes through the middle of the street. I was referred to the other district and a month later a nurse arrived, as the person doing the assesments was on holidays. She took a look at me, asked a couple of questions and said I was mentally too bright to go into a nursing home, so nothing was needed. Unable to manage with the increased pain I saw a local Doctor who referred me back to the hospital after diagnosing the hip problem. I was transferred to the hospital in my district (Osborne Park) for rehabilitation, but as it was Saturday nothing would happen till Monday. I was told to go home and that someone from the hospital would be in touch Monday. 3 months later I received a letter from the Osborne Park Hospital for an appointment to a Orthopedic specialist for 9 months later. Due to the delays , I believe there is a good chance it may be too late to repair the muscle and 2 crutches may have to be used forever as my hip is giving way.

Story: I had a recent stay in Narrabri hospital after a car accident. The ED nurses I saw were fantastic, I was not used to this country hospital thing where they have to ring a local doctor, but he arrived promptly and seemed very knowledgeable and thorough. I was appalled however, at the night staff I saw on the ward. To me they seemed rude, pushy and noisy! I could not get any sleep at all and one nurse I heard even used the F word in almost every sentence. The day time nurses I came into contact with were great, but the night staff I saw, in my opinion, were horrible.

Author: the patient
Story: In 2010 I sustained a serious back injury while I was at work. Two days later the pain elevated to such severe levels I had to be transported to Redland Hospital in Cleveland. I stayed in the emergency department short stay unit for two nights where I encountered a doctor who did not seem to take my injury seriously, making me get out of bed to go to the toilet instead of inserting a catheter which within a couple of hours was necessary due to urinary retention. I was in severe discomfort after being forced to get out of bed to go to the toilet. Ultimately I had surgery to decompress a nerve root at the L5S1 level. The ED doctor was in my opinion indifferent and unbelieving about the level of pain I was in. Being a nurse myself I got to experience 1st hand what it is like to suffer at the hands of an uncaring doctor who appeared to have major issues understanding what pain is and how it affects people who are in shock after suffering such horrendous acute, traumatic back injuries.

Story: When I booked in for the surgery, I presented the reception staff with a form signed by my doctor, to have patient transport to and from the procedure earlier in 2012. I was assured the transport would be arranged and pick me up in plenty of time for me to get to the hospital. I waited for about 3/4 hour, but no transport turned up. I then had to phone the hospital to find out what transport service was to have picked me up and was patched through to the ambulance service. I was informed that CODI handled the transport. As I am recently moved here from Victoria, I had no idea what CODI stood for or did. However, I phoned the number supplied by the ambulance service and the CODI telephonist told me she would arrange the transport and that the return trip would cost $20. I paid the $20 to the driver who picked me up and he said that covered the return trip. I have since been billed for a further $20, despite objecting to the charge. As a pensioner who does not like to owe money, I was not impressed by the extra $20 being billed to me.

Title: PTSD and cuts to treatment via Better Access. Gympie
Time: 2012-04-14T01:39:46Z
Location: Queensland;
Author: the patient
Story: I am experiencing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This has had a terrible impact on my life. I think my psychologist is a god send and has saved my life. The Better Access Initiative has allowed me treatment. The visits to the Psychologist are scheduled at $200 per hour but my particular psychologist charges only $100.00 per visit and I am required to pay approx $20.00 out of this amount and the rest is paid by Medicare. We live in a rural area and our current Mental health and Disability services are stretched to the max. I have been told that I can go to a Psychiatrist who monitors medicine and then refers me to a psychologist but the unfortunate facts are we have one psychiatrist who attends our area and visits fortnightly. He will not be visiting for another 5 weeks. The waiting list is 2-3 months and the out of pocket cost to me would be 2 to 5 times plus what I can get from my current health care provider. I am very grateful to the Better Access Initiative and to the Medicare system for their assistance for without it I would not have received the beneficial results that I am experiencing. Due to the severity of my illness I have been eligible for up to 18 visits per year and then having to pay for any additional treatment out of my Disability Payment. This is an incredible increase to any budget let alone someone who has minimum income. Over the last three years my health is steadily improving due to the professional care I have been able to access under this scheme. If I cannot obtain the timely treatment that I need, I am at great risk of an increase in symptoms and decline in my progress. PTSD and many other mental health concerns and illnesses can also be a death sentence if left untreated. I believe this decision to decrease visits to our chosen professional could result in many vulnerable citizens taking their life. The Better Access program allows all Australians to access professional psychological care. People like me need all the help they can get so that they will be able to get well and get back into the work force. I do not need to have my needs pushed under a carpet and forgotten or treated any less than the next human being. â€ƒ I am trying every thing that I can to regain my health but this arbitrary decision is seriously impeding my progress and well being. Given professional care with a carer of my choice my prognosis is recovery in 5-7 years maximum. I am recovering much faster due to my monumental efforts. I have had a big struggle to accept this condition and the impacts that it has had on my life e.g. not being able to earn a living, not being able to parent my children on a daily basis and having to deal with the issues that have arisen as a result of the traumas. I am not a victim and do not act like one. I am a brave and proactive woman who desperately needs the support of my Government representatives to assist me whilst I am most vulnerable. I am looking for a hand up, not a hand out. Until such times as the new system (ATAPS) etc proves itself to be as effective as the Better Access program I ask that the Better Access remains in place in its initial capacity. Reinstate the 18 visits per year; in fact, evidence proves that up to 26 visits per year are advisable. It would appear that I can have up to 50 visits to a Psychiatrist per annum, not my chosen method. My point is if the Government allows me to have 50 visits to a service that may not help and is far more expensive, both to the consumer and Medicare, then why canâ€™t I have the equivalent Dollar value to choose who is most successful in treating me and aiding my recovery? The argument provided by the current government that the Better Access is costing more than expected proves that there is a genuine need in our community and a need for this proven successful model to continue. The proposal of allowing 10 visits to a professional and then another 10 group sessions is an insult to me and my right to choose the care I need. I have absolutely no desire to share my very personal and painful story in a group or over the internet. Our local ATAP centre has a cut off of 8 visits and no assurances that I will have continuity of care with the same Psychologist, counsellor. I believe this decision will have a devastating kickback on all our communities.

Story: Two years ago I changed GPs from one I thought wasn't pushing hard enough on my depression to another a friend recommended. I'm finding this new GP will do things if I ask her directly, but her main pre occupation seems to be getting me to have blood tests & reduce my weight! She seems obsessed with heart health, despite the fact that I have long term depression that's difficult to keep controlled and life-long asthma [that I've learned to manage myself]. My blood pressure has been a bit high for years and recently I've started medication, my weight is at the upper end of normal range & never fluctuates & my cholesterol levels have always been good. Yet the GP is always suggesting I lose weight & now when I have just started on thyroid meds for Hashimoto's disease, she mysteriously suggested that perhaps I might like the tabs too much. I've since discovered that thyroid pills are sometimes abused by people who want to lose weight- but it would not have occurred to me. I think my GP is obsessed with her own weight so that she seems to be missing aspects of my health that are not related to weight. I don't want to change GPs again but she's annoying me! I've told her I'm not worried about my weight at present & that I exercise regularly but not always for 20mins/day as recommended.

The ER doctors and nurses I saw were also fantastic and looked after me extremely well. I had 2 Operations and I have an external Fixator on my leg. My bad experiences started with the nursing care in the ward. It was a terrible experience for me. I spent 10 days in hospital. In my opinion, the nurses I saw were very unclean, I never got offered a wash or even a chance to be able to clean my teeth. Ended up with infections where the drip was attached 3 times. One nurse in particular was just plain nasty to me. Also in the middle of the night, one nurse changed my IV bag, then came running back in about 20 min later and told me she was sorry, she had hooked up the wrong bag to me. I had to ask them over and over again to clean the pin sites, they just kept saying in a minute, which ended up turning into several hours. I have so many complaints about the nurses.

When told to settle he got louder, the "f" word was coming thick and fast and there was at least 30 patients in surgery plus registrars and PGPPP doctors. He went back to his room and the manager proceeded to make excuses for his behaviour, and did not seem to appear to help the reception staff. I have witnessed this behaviour many times over the last few years. Is anger management compulsory for GPs? In my opinion it should be and de briefing for reception staff.

Story: I had to take my husband (aged 86, alziehmers) to the Redcliffe Hospital with a suspected broken wrist. After signing in and having his bloods pressure taken we sat in the waiting room. The waiting room had a chart similar to the bush fire warning chart and was set to extreme, but it gave no indication of what approximate amount of time 'extreme' meant ie. 2-4hrs. They also had a video playing which explained that patients were taken on need, not a first come first serve basis. About 1 hour later my husband was taken to have his heart imaged. After another 1 1/2 hours I approched the counter and ask if they could tell me what was happening to him. After a phone call I was told that a bed had been found for him and I could go there where I remained for the rest of the visit. 4 1/2 hours after our arrival we were told that his wrist was not broken and we were free to go. Whilst I could not fault the demeanour of the staff I saw, I was annoyed that no-one seemed to have thought to tell me that my husband had been moved to a bed.

Author: the patient
Story: In my opinion doctors are meant to listen, test, diagnose and treat but in my experience I am yet to come across a specialist who listens to me. In the last 2 years I have not gotten a diagnosis for any of my myriad problems. My GP doesn't seem to think that a person in their 30â€™s with memory problems (I can only remember the last 2 years, it may be longer) is a big deal. Truth is the entire of 2009 is a blank for me! I cannot work full-time while I have these problems and it seems to me that someone of my financial standing (poorly paid perm PT) is not, in my opinion, to be bestowed with the privilege of detailed, in-depth or timely medical treatment. My GP is pretty good but he seems to get to a certain point in an investigation and then he goes no further. It appears that I am put into the too hard basket too easily. The doctor who kicked me out on the second visit said another doctor would call me back in a week..it's been a year. I am a public patient but I've lost count of how much of my small amount of money I've spent on private doctors because I can't wait 12 - 18 months to see a public doctor. I paid $120 for what seemed like less than 5 mins work and that is a little less than a whole dayâ€™s pay for me. I live in a rural town that has only just got a couple doctors who come from the next town in the last few years. There is no public transport. If I had a limb lopped off accidentally, I would gladly crawl straight past my local hospital, right past the closest city hospital and I would cross my fingers at the Brisbane hospital. I travel to Ipswich for my medical care.

Story: Recently my daughter fell quite ill with the side affects of numerous boils on her body. After a visit to our doctor and a week of being on antibiotics it was suggested that we take her straight to hospital. I was initially reluctant to go to Redcliffe as have personally had a bad experience there, but it was closer and I was keen to see my child attended to as quickly as possible. On arrival at Emergency there were already quite a number of people waiting and I thought we were in for a long waiting period. Much to my relief and delight our wait was minimal with the attending doctor being very thorough, even asking for a second opinion on best course of action. We felt our concerns had been validated. I guess everyone needs a second chance in providing a better service and I felt, as an anxious mother, that Redcliffe Hospital certainly delivered on this occasion.

Story: Visiting my Grandchild, I had envisioned this ward to be a bright & airy and thought it had much work in recent times in an attempt to modernise & upgrade. However in my opinion it seemed depressing, dingy, ugly, cramped & was not attractive in any way, ward for children. Along with this the nurses I saw appeared to be unhappy, (which I could understand) unhelpful, ( with a couple of exceptions) but contributing zilch to the environment of the place. I was amazed at all this, thinking every effort had been made to make life as good as possible for patients & parents in unwanted situations.

Story: My mother was given an intravenous antibiotic that she was allergic to after I left her in the Emergency Dept. one night at 1am as I was too sick with a bad head cold to stay any longer. She then developed a raging rash on her body which I noticed the next morning when I went in to see her. When I commented on the rash they agreed she had a rash and seemed to wonder why. I had to ask them if she'd had antibiotics and which one she' been given. When I was told which one I informed them she was allergic to that one. Her medical records were then checked and the staff agreed that yes it was documented as an allergy! They did not apologize or admit their error ...just that yes she was allergic to that antibiotic. I was told by a Registered Nurse at the hospital (when I rang and complained) that I should contact the HCCC (Health Care Complaints Commission) which I did but the person there was unable to talk to me at that point in time and took my phone number to ring me back. When she rang me back approx. 4 days later I was too upset to talk to her as my mother had been readmitted to hospital in a critical condition and died the next day of Acute Renal Failure as stated on her Death Certificate. I don't know if this error resulted in her death or if she was going to die of renal failure anyway as she had chronic 'Heart Failure' anyway.

Author: the patient
Story: I was recently admitted to hospital for chest pain. I was taken in by ambulance nurses and doctors in the emergency department. I was extremely concerned about the nurse who was attending to me and an elderly patient in the very next bed. This nurse seemed to speak very loudly about how the hospital had apparently failed to pay her relocation costs. It appeared that she spoke about this to staff members and to patients. At one stage, whilst tending the elderly woman in the next bed, I overheard her yell, seemingly so a passing nurse could hear her, that if they made her do that rotation without training her first, sheâ€™ll tell them to get stuffed. To me it seemed she was referring to a rotation to haul and layout the dead bodies. The elderly lady next door who, in my opinion, was clearly palliative wisely advised her that "get nicked" was a much nicer term. Of much greater concern to me was that particular nurseâ€™s ability to, apparently lie to other medical staff regarding the elderly womanâ€™s care. I witnessed the elderly lady being given what appeared to me to be a diuretic to encourage the passing of urine. I saw this being given prior to this nurse coming on shift. It seemed to me that the diuretic medication given to the elderly lady began to work soon after this nurse came on shift, as she began requesting support to use the toilet regularly. I hadnâ€™t seen the elderly lady go to the toilet prior to this. The nurse appeared to groan at the woman telling her she needed to calm down as no one needs to go to the toilet that much (from what I saw the elderly lady went 2 times in first hour and 3 times in the second hour). When this advice didn't solve the problem my impression was that the nurse appeared to order a valium to apparently calm her nerves. I felt it necessary to explain to the nurse that I think the woman had been given a medication to encourage urination. The nurse checked the medication chart and seemed to realise this had occurred. This however was after the woman had been given the valium. In my opinion the elderly woman was also very worried about her cats which were locked in at home. The nurse , who to me did not seem to be listening to the patient, told me (in what I would describe as a loud voice) and my mother, who was present with me the entire time, that the elderly lady was clearly incoherent and rambling. The nurse also asked us if we heard her rambling about the cats. I was very disturbed by the entire experience. Finally, at midnight, I decided to go to the toilet for the first time since I arrived. I asked the same nurse to assist me with unplugging the machines. She told me I should try and hold off as the toilets were hideous. I needed to go, so I proceeded despite the advice and sure enough I was confronted with a urine-soaked floor and toilet seat and an unrolled and wet toilet roll. Whilst this may not be the nurseâ€™s job I think she could have alerted someone to the state of the facility, particularly given the need for a sterile clinical environment to avoid further risk to patients. Wagga Base Hospital is finally turning the tide and providing excellent clinical services to our community but in my opinion nurses like this one drag it right back.

I question what they were - to be told aspirin & codeine - I pointed out to her that on the form I told them I was allergic to aspirin. She then put me down the hall in a room with 2 panadeine & told me she would call a doctor. Meanwhile I was still vomiting & the doctor arrived & asked my husband what did we want him to do. No examination was made. By this time I told him I thought my head was going to explode. He got the nurse to give me an injection - this was 30 min later - I was then left to throw up for another 30 minutes when the wards man walked past & said he would get someone to help. The doctor came back in & looked in my eyes & got the nurse to give me another needle & said I could see my own doctor the following day which was Saturday - he then sent me home. I can't believe that I had no tests done in the emergency unit at this hospital - at the time I was sure there was something seriously wrong. I now have to wait til Tuesday as the doctor surgery was too busy to fit me in.

Story: My gum near my wisdom tooth was very sore and I could not delay seeing the dentist any longer, however, I had to find a new dentist as my previous one was no longer convenient as it was at my uni. As I am finished uni I wanted to go somewhere closer to home. I was worried about how much this visit would cost. My last dentist did not give me a hint as to how much I would be paying for the visit nor did he ask me (as a poor uni student) would I be able to afford $250 for a filling. I booked an appointment at Nundah Village Dental after looking at their website which was informative and patient friendly. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful. When I told her the reason for my appointment she suggested getting an x-ray of my wisdom teeth (bulk bill at Nundah Radiology which was only round the corner from the dentist) as it would help the dentist diagnose the problem. I dropped in to get the referral for the x-ray then headed to Nundah Radiology. I was pleased that I did not have to wait too long for the scan. The radiologist was pleasant and I had my scan done quickly and images even quicker. My dentist appointment was with Anna. She was very friendly and appeared happy and immediately I felt at ease. After she took some x-rays she explained what was going on with my teeth. She explained to me my options and prices of procedures that needed to be done to keep my teeth healthy. She was very informative and made me feel very comfortable. We worked out a dental plan that suited me and my budget (and my teeth!). I was happy that it was not too expensive and reasonably priced. I can say that this visit to the dentist was the best I have ever experienced. I now know how much my next two visits will cost so I can budget appropriately and why it is so important to floss every day! I am actually looking forward to going back and making regular 6 month visits which I have previously avoided. I also like how I can book an appointment on Saturday. What a great experience and friendly staff! Nundah Village had some great health services and health professionals. I am yet to be disappointed.

Story: I attended a Men's Health event. It was informative and entertaining. I have a number of health issues. I realised after the men's Health night that the treatment for all, bar the heart/blood pressure, by my local GP had now seemed, in my opinion, patchy & reactive - unplanned, irregular & only occurring when I presented for something else. The phrase "your blood sugar/blood pressure is up a bitâ€? was a regular feature during irregular consultations. So I asked for a suggestion for another GP. I have since seen that GP a number of times and am very satisfied with the management plan he is developing. He told me that my lymphoma is cured, which lifted a huge weight off my mind. I hope more men get the message at information sessions like these.

I am most impressed with this service and would recommend it to anyone. I noted also visitors to Wagga Wagga made up some of the patients in the waiting room, this may be because they are being referred by moteliers and members of the public to this great service.

As it happened I battled infections for the next 3 weeks. I saw my doctor once only the next morning after the op though I was anxious about my health. The other doctor did come to see me when I was being discharged with my problem still not resolved. When I phoned the dr's office during the next couple of weeks I was referred to the nurse who was polite to me the first call but in subsequent call seemed to became very defensive and impatient with me.

Time: 2012-09-06T00:17:44Z
Location: South Australia;
Author: the patient
Story: I was referred by my GP to a registered clinical psychologist for severe depression after having antidepressants prescribed. The psychologist seemed very nice on first impressions, was similar in age to me & proposed concentrating on the present, not digging up the painful past. The second time I went, she seemed to have forgotten what she had told me already & that we had agreed on the mindfulness approach. She went through another type of preliminary explanation/assessment & I asked her about the 'mindfulness' & I was told that we would make the decision next time. I decided to go along for the 3rd appointment (and I was pretty distressed by then, not having any new strategies to help me cope) even though it didn't seem promising. The third appointment started badly with her seeming to forget my story again & I left suddenly, crying, ran to my car & drove off. I was really crook & drove about 150kms away from the city before I calmed down - that's an old habit (driving in the country to feel better). No one rang to check I was Ok & I wasn't brave enough to see anyone else for 18 months until I became really suicidal. Also, under the Better Access Program, I would be counted as recovered in only 3 sessions but I was the opposite! I know several of my friends have parallel stories involving anxiety/panic disorder treatment.

Author: the patient
Story: I asked my GP to refer me again to a psychiatrist I had seen for some sessions 2 years before. The psychiatrist agreed to see me for a gap charge of only $20 per session as I had no job or income. Since I had been suicidal on a high dose of antidepressants she told me I had few alternative medications to try and that most would have longer term side effects than the ones I was on (which had weird side effects I coped with). She then got me to experiment with a combination of a lower dose of my antidepressant but added several non-traditional things. The psychiatrist also prescribed exercise and socialising (eg. talk to a shop assistant, have a coffee) and recommended a diet high in protein with fresh fruit & vegies (I was already eating this way). After 6 months I feel well nearly all the time, I halved my dose of antidepressants & I have absolutely no strange "brain-zap" side effects from Effexor! I've also been taught all sorts of thinking strategies to help me be positive & active & I know when to stop myself thinking in unhelpful directions when my "triggers" happen. I am not just medicated, I'm thinking and behaving more adaptively and starting to achieve things in life again. I believe this mixed treatment approach has worked for me.

Story: I have good health so rarely need to go to the doctor. However, I had been experience regular discomfort and pain over a three day period and was concerned enough to go to the After Hours clinic. For me it was a very unsatisfactory experience. When I went in the doctor did not introduce themself nor make eye contact. It felt like it was a real burden for me to be there. After asking me what was wrong the doctor asked no further questions, sought no further information and, quite frankly, seemed bored. After what I would describe as a very cursory examination I was advised that I should take some panadol. I was appalled. I had absolutely no confidence that the doctor had listened, nor cared. I had no confidence in his 'professional' assessment. I feel I may as well have stood in the middle of the street and thrown away $70. The following week, I went to my own doctor who asked questions, seemed to listen, make eye contact, suggested possible causes for the problem and ordered a test. I hope to never have to attend the after hours service again.

Story: I had a good experience with my colonoscopy. I really liked the way that the staff greeted me warmly and invited me to ask any questions. At all times I felt like I was in good hands. Of particular praise was both the admission nurse who explained things very clearly, and the anaethetists who introduced himself to me before the procedure. Even as I was about to have my procedure, the accompanying nurse introduced herself wtih a friendly smile. It certainly made me feel valued and in good hands. My only suggestion for improvement would be that I never got to meet the doctor that did my procedure. Perhaps he was too busy or that wasn't the protocol. But what would have taken this service from A-class to A+ class would have been a quick hello from the doctor saying something like "I'll be your doctor doing the procedure and just want to let you know that we'll look after you" or something like that. It wasn't a big deal but afterall he was getting personal with my body, so I guess putting a face to the doctor would have made the service that little bit more personal.

Author: the patient
Story: I have sought the services of several GP's related to my Osteoarthritis and I am currently receiving a Centrelink benefit. I am also currently not working, however, I am educated and I am well versed in chronic pain. I understand my condition does not have a cure and that self-management with exercise, not pain medication, has been the best treatment for me so far. I get frustrated with the GP who firstly doesn't communicate very well and secondly seems to assume that I am ignorant about my own arthritis, that I don't know what I'm talking about and that I am trying to rip off the government with benefits. I have a lot of arthritis but not all of it is severe, so the GP doesn't seem to understand why I can't work. I require medical certificates for the government. I feel I have done everything the GP's, and physio's have asked me to do, but slowly my arthritis gets worse. I do not believe this is not my fault and I am not to blame. I am not asking for medication from them and I do not think I have unrealistic expectations from my GP. I am unable to exercise at the rate I used to, and I need hydro-therapy exercises and manipulation from a physio, which need to be government sponsored. I believe the GP could do a lot better than talking to me as if I know nothing about my pain condition and am not doing what I was asked to do.

Title: Admitted for urinary tract problems - Mater public Brisbane

Author: the patient
Story: I had a prostatectomy in July and appeared to recover from this procedure. However, after a month or so I began to experience some bleeding when urinating and also difficulty when undertaking this function. When it became worse I decided to see medical assistance. On the advice of my doctor I was admitted to the emergency department at the Mater Private Hospital where a catheter was fitted and an irrigation of my bladder and urinary tract was undertaken. I was advised there has been an infection and this was subsequently overcome. Everything went well , the care I received was good as was the food and attitude of the nursing staff and doctors that looked after me.

Title: Excessive diagnosis

Author: a relative
Story: My four year old had woken with a hot, red, swollen ear (at least four times its original size). Apart from the swelling to my childâ€™s ear and gland directly below the ear, there were no other issues-no pain, no fever, no itchiness, no discomfort, and eating was normal and playing was normal. We had spent the previous day gardening and I assumed it had been bite by something or had a reaction to a plant. I administered an antihistamine and took my child to a pharmacy to double check. The pharmacist was quite alarmed and suggested I get to a Dr or the ED if the antihistamine had no affect after about an hour. I phoned the afterhours clinic in the morning and was told to call back when they re-opened in the afternoon and I would be able to see someone after 5pm so I called the ED in the hope to find out the rough waiting time-I didnâ€™t want to spend three or four hours waiting in ED when I could get to the clinic in six hours. The ED put me through the nurse on call hotline-they informed me if there were no signs of pain, fever, problems swallowing/eating or any balance issues then I would be fine to wait to get into the clinic. I phoned the clinic when it opened and got an appointment shortly after. When we arrived at the afterhours clinic the admin staff we saw were amazing and so friendly and welcoming to both me and my child. The receptionist spoke to my child, showed what she was doing and made my child feel so comfortable in a new environment. We waited 40min and then went into the doctor, who was very friendly, introduced themself and asked what was wrong. After my explanation the doctor took my childâ€™s temperature, it was normal. The doctor looked in the ears and said the swollen one looked slightly red. The doctor felt behind the ear and asked if there was any pain, my child answered that it hurt a little bit, but did not once wince or move head away from the Dr, like I would suspect a child to if they felt pain. The Dr then seemed to quickly diagnosed the illness as mastoiditis and explained the infection to me and I questioned that there hadnâ€™t been any accompanying fever or pain. The doctor said that they donâ€™t always appear as a symptom and prescribed antibiotics but also requested I visit my own Dr the next day. I found this to be an odd request. If the doctor diagnosed my child with an infection, prescribed antibiotics then why would I need to see my own Dr the next day? I would understand if the after-hours doctor said to visit my own Dr if the infection got worse, but it seemed like they were seeking a second opinion. I did a bit of research into mastoiditis. From what I could tell my child had no symptoms of this infection other than a swollen ear. I administered the antibiotics as directed and booked an appointment the following morning with our regular Dr. She thoroughly checked my child out and said it was definitely not mastoiditis. I was told it was more likely to be a mild reaction to a bite, sting or plant allergy. At that point the ear had reduced in swelling somewhat, but it was still over twice its normal size. She said as the swelling had reduced she was unsure if it were the antibiotics or the antihistamine that had treated the problem so I was to continue the antibiotics for the full course and give one more dose of antihistamines. I left feeling relieved but somewhat annoyed at what I perceived to be an excessive diagnosis the afterhours doctor had given us and perhaps the course of unnecessary antibiotics, however, I came to the conclusion that I would prefer an â€˜over diagnosisâ€™ to an â€˜under diagnosisâ€™ any day. I would far prefer a diagnosis of mastoiditis for a mild allergic reaction than a diagnosis a mild allergic reaction for mastoiditis. Please donâ€™t read this as a complaint in anyway. I was happy with our treatment at the after hours clinic, however I did want to provide you with this feedback. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to attend an afterhourâ€™s clinic rather than to clog up the ED and spend, what could have been hours waiting for not so serious issues, so thank you!

Story: Greg the Dentist at Kedron is fantastic! I had firstly taken my daughter (3yrs) to a pediatric dentist who charged a fortune (>$200 for an initial consultation for about 20min, no xrays, no treatment, just a look!), and in my opinion seemed to have very poor skills with children and only looked in her mouth for a minute (although her nursing staff were great). I then took my daughter to my local dentist for the check-up a year later. He was fantastic. He was thorough, talked to her to make her comfortable with him, gave me advice and addressed my concerns. Then the gap was waived after my private health paid for the consult, costing me nothing! I have sent my whole family to him from then on! In my opinion he was honest, had a great bed-side manner and was a pleasure to visit. I think he is good at his job and all my family are happy with his skills!

Author: a relative
Story: Our son is hearing impaired and has other borderline impairments. His hearing levels have deteriorated significantly in the last 18 months. We were referred by our ENT to the specialist services at the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane. This included pediatric, neurology and recently genetic services, seen over the last 15 months. The braid aim was to identify any cause or elements that could be acted upon to halt or slow the rate of loss. After previously being underwhelmed with services that focussed on cause rather than management we were a little apprehensive about investing our time over again. On the whole, there have been some hits and misses in terms of care. The first thing worth noting is that appointments were generally on time - great for working parents! Initial interaction with pediatrics was great - thorough investigation of past history. Also, the Doctor called us a number of times to advise the results of certain tests, which was a pleasant surprise! Other areas were more frustrating. When we go to such specialists we are expecting them to take leadership and guide us with their expertise. Many times we felt we were being asked to set the agenda for what treatment should be explored, or identify what 'conditions' are important or not.

Author: the patient
Story: I was in A&E at Flinders Medical Centre (FMC) across dinner time, following a road accident. As soon as I arrived I told the nurses and doctors, that I have T1 diabetes and would need some insulin before 8PM, or my blood sugars would go up. The nurse told me that they werenâ€™t going to feed me. As if I was asking for food - even without food, I knew would still need insulin. The doctors I saw did not appear to be interested. This was before I had Lantus, DAFNE and a correction bolus ratio. I told them I didnâ€™t know how much insulin to have if I wasnâ€™t eating. The staff that were looking after me didnâ€™t seem to take any notice. My blood glucose was up from what it was at the scene of the accident. A few days later I was back in A&E. The next day my blood glucose came down and I was transferred to the Spinal Unit at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH). The last time I was in this hospital my diabetes was not managed well, in my opinion this was because I was not in the Diabetes ward, so I knew I had to be assertive about managing my diabetes well, so I could recover faster. The Endos came to see me soon after Iâ€™d arrived in the ward, so it seemed all was going to be OK. That night I did not get any long-acting insulin, despite repeated requests, and asking for an endocrinologist. After a while the nurses didnâ€™t respond to my buzzer. So disempowering and alarming. Next morning one of the Endos came to see me, just to add insult to injury, tried to blame me for my blood glucose going up overnight. I did some assertive talking about long acting insulin and keeping diabetes stable. There was a registrar on call, who did not act and call the Endo on who was on call. So why werenâ€™t they called???? Later one of the Endo students came to see me, a good chat about the importance of keeping diabetes stable, and how best to do that. The student was intelligent, receptive and understanding. An endo arrived who had introduced herself and said she was from Endocrinology, without telling me her position (student, registrar, doctor, professor, cleaner), but to me it seemed she was clearly senior to the student. She admitted to being the one who had withheld my long acting insulin last night. Through my contained rage I gave her a good, positive, polite, assertive talking to about the importance of keeping diabetes stable. It appeared to me that she had a lot to learn about diabetes, and a lot to learn about consulting with consumers. I was most annoyed that sheâ€™d done this without discussing it with me, without considering the predictable effect of missing the long-acting. Two weeks after the accident, I saw my GP. He told me other people have had worse outcomes. I take that to mean they died. He was most emphatic that I write a letter of complaint to Flinders about my diabetes being ignored on the night of the accident. Emergency staff ignoring diabetes is not on. In my opinion this is an issue has to be dealt with. If my diabetes was managed in A&E on the night of the accident, I do not think I would have spent long hours in A&E, and several nights in the Spinal Unit. The letter of complaint to Flinders Medical Centre got no action.

They seemed to pay close attention to my individual needs and not just provide information on a general health basis. We had been feeling isolated and disconnected in the area and they really improved our sense of connection to health in the area, and connected us to health reach, and things like podiatrists, dentists, dieticians. They were even helpful in regards to things like head lice and the school health service and Department of Education. They were absolutely wonderful and I just can't say enough about them.

Story: Having pointed out the urgency to my GP, because this injury was a result of a car accident and was being assessed by the CTP insurer and that medical accounts would only be paid up to a time when final investigation was completed, I suggested that it would be good to get the problem sorted out as soon as possible with a specialist! My GP was in full agreement and was sympathetic to the reasons for the urgency. Likewise the specialist Orthopaedic Surgeon Dr. B was equally understanding and was an extremely pleasant doctor to talk to. He discussed the symptoms and suggested, after some tests, that before referring me for an MRI that he was pretty sure that the diagnosis was a "frozen shoulder" and to be treated with a specialised cortisone injection into the shoulder area sack of fluid would probably be a solution. He explained that having relieved the pain it would then take some time for the shoulder to settle down! The injection was also arranged in a very short time and the costs of all this was taken care of by the CTP insurers whilst still under investigation. My appreciation to both doctors and the doctor giving the injection, who were all sympathetic to the urgency of the requirements.

Story: I made the appointment specifically because it was bulk billing and I felt I could basically diagnose myself but I had never been to this practice before. As a new patient I had to fill in a form and give details to the receptionist, not once did she look me in the eye, even when I asked questions. I felt I was treated like I didn't exist, in other words I felt there was no "customer service". The GP then proceeded to diagnose antibiotics for my cold sore and did not look in my eye despite the fact I said I had conjunctivitis. Once I asked the doctor to take a closer look (the doctor did) but I didn't see any hand washing before or after, despite proceeding to give me antibiotic drops for my highly contagious conjunctivitis. Needless to say I won't be going back, even for the bulk billing option.

Title: Waiting lists at hospital causing mental anguish and trauma

Author: the patient
Story: I attended the arthritis clinic at Box Hill Hospital and was told by the person that i saw to go home and do physio for the rest of my life as there was nothing they could do for me. My husband and I left in tears due to the thought that I would have to suffer with pain due to the seemingly incompetence of the person who was apparently unable to recognize the severity of my ex rays, that were very obvious to me and my husband as they appeared very disfigured. I had an appointment already arranged to speak with a surgeon two weeks later so I rang to cancel the thinking that it would be a waste of time. Luckily the receptionist advised us to keep the appointment. The surgeon immediately looked at my ex rays that the arthritis clinic had seen two weeks prior and seemed to realized the excruciating pain I was in due to bone on bone deterioration and put me on the three month waiting list for immediate surgery. We again left in tears due to relief that something could be done. I would like to thank Box Hill Hospital Orthopaedic surgery doctors and staff that looked after me, for their wonderful conscientious work but unfortunately their brilliant work has suffered due to the dreadful waiting lists. While my first knee post op was healing my knee that still needed surgery was excruciatingly painful so I was very limited in my recovery of both knees. 7 months wait for second op. I also found out later that after my first knee op I was given the wrong exercises by the hospital. The exercises I was given were hip exercises not knee. That combined with the waiting list for cataract surgery at the Eye and Ear hospital lead me to be so limited with vision and my ability to exercise properly left me with Pulmonary Embolisms that nearly killed me. In my opinion the physical and mental pain I suffered over a twelve month period was tantamount to torture. I believe that in the end the staff were able to force me into the system but by then a lot of the emotional damage had been done. I was unlucky enough to have my second knee surgery on the very day that a nurses strike was called and was terrified to wake from surgery in a ward amongst dementia patients that were screaming and abusive . They had been moved from a ward that was forced to close that morning. 24 hrs later I was moved into another room after a wonderful male nurse seemed to take pity on me as I lay terrified quietly in the corner unable to move or sleep or recover. I was then moved into a two bed room and for 24 hrs. It was ok until the poor woman in the bed next to me, who had a broken knee joint and was awaiting emergency surgery for two days, fell into a diabetic coma and staff flew in from every direction (thank god) to help. The problem was that due to the small room my bed with me in it had to be pushed sideways against the wall. I totally understand but after the crisis (and she was ok) I was left there with no privacy ,no alarm for the nurse as it was broken, no TV as it was broken, no pain killers, unable to get out of the bed and I had just witnessed a woman nearly die. Not one person or nurse came to me for over 4 hrs until my husband came to visit. I was so frightened I signed myself out of hospital with 37 staples in my knee and panadol because I felt I would be in a safer environment at home. I still hadn't even seen a physiotherapist until twenty minutes before I went home on day three as they were on strike with the nurses, but I received excellent care from the home services the very next day. It was a very very very frightening experience for me. I still am disturbed about the things that I witnessed in those three days. It has been some months since that dreadful experience and I am still recovering from the consequences. I believe so much of my pain and suffering could have been avoided by simply shorter waiting periods that would lead to less deterioration of my physical and mental health while waiting for borderline emergency care. I am trying every day to become a little stronger and recover but I am left disabled to the point of not being able to return to work in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately now I need care provided by my husband who is no longer able to work.

Story: My daughter who has chronic fatigue was given an in-office test for HPylori. It showed a positive and she was prescribed a med, a three fold approach using antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors. On the third day she became quite unwell. My online research showed this was not unusual. I advised the doctor who totally seemed to deny that it could have been the med. as she worsened to a state of constant unsettled stomach, reduced food intake and sleeping sitting up. It appeared to me that the doctor again and again failed to suggest any solution to this dilemma. I contacted the manufacturer of the med who were surprised that given her reaction she was not put on a follow up dose of another proton pump inhibitor to stop the acid reflux. Once we started that med it took quite some time for her to be able to eat comfortably, she continued to sleep sitting up for a period of 2 months....on top of chronic fatigue issues. Nows here is the rub...eventually we went in again to see the GP who performed yet another in office HPylori test which again showed positive and he dared suggest she may have to do the mess yet again. Two days later I had her in for an endoscopy with Prof. of gastroenterology who said there was no sign of HPylori present and no indication of previous presence of HPylori.

X-rays were done and the doctor told us that there was no break, and for her to take panadol and walk it off! The next afternoon the doctor called me and said there was a slight break and asked if we could come in the next day for a colleague to plaster it. The colleague put the x-rays up and it appeared very obvious to us that there was a break. A scan was ordered and we were told that she may need surgery. The next day we got a call to attend the orthopaedics clinic where we were told she did need surgery and screws would have to be inserted. That was in October last year. My daughter spent 6 months on crutches and still has pain in the foot. I donâ€™t know if the damage done was worse because of that doctor who didnâ€™t see the break initially. I'm still really angry that an emergency doctor missed this, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s good enough.

Story: I arrived in the evening and registered my Medicare number and my childâ€™s name at reception. I was informed there would be a wait as there were 5 people ahead of me. I thought that was fine, that wasnâ€™t a large number and possibly we wouldn't be waiting all that long. We waited patiently for nearly two hours before we were seen by a doctor only to be told he will need an x-ray after a 2 minute consult (understandably) so off we went to x-ray waiting in that reception area once again until it was x-rayed. We were sent back to reception only to wait another hour for the doctor again to see the xray's and determine a result. Finally we were seen - only for the doctor to have difficulty finding anything and then discovers he thinks he has a fracture in his thumb - I couldn't see one but I am not a GP either so I went along with his advice to plaster the hand arm and thumb. Come Thursday we are asked to see another practitioner to view the thumb and x-rays again only to wait yet another 45 minutes in the actual consult room for a doctor. Once a doctor did arrive he couldn't find my son's x-rays on their computer system, so I handed him my copy I had, only for him to tell me there was no fracture to my son's thumb. What a waste of our time!!!! I understand I have to wait in the public system and I am happy to do that but to be misdiagnosed from the beginning and putting my 5 year old thru the trauma of that was really ridiculous and, in my opinion, not very professional.

Story: My second child was crowning, her water broke and from what I could see there was meconium, I didnâ€™t not think there was any risk if the umbilical cord was left to give my baby all her blood and she was not left gasping for air. I also donâ€™t believe there was a need to remove my child from me in order to stimulate breathing via rubbing up or anything. Seconds later when she was born her cord was clamped and cut, severing her blood supply from the placenta, and my vigerous, healthy, screaming baby was taken across to the other side of the room to wipe all the healthy vernix off of her and rub her up - all which were, in my opinion, uneccessary and dangerous to her and to our bonding - all of which I believe could have been done with her in my arms! I specifically had in my birth plan that her cord was not to be cut till the placenta was birthed. I was the third or fourth person to hold and touch my baby â€“in my opinion i should have been the first. I think they wronged both of our entire experience. I am angry and in my opinion it is not good enough. Due to this and also a previous experience I never will birth in hospital again unless one of us is clearly dying.

Story: My visit to a Tristar Medical Centre. I believe the doctor lied to me. The doctor and the ultrasound tech we used told me a story about seeing meconium in the water on the ultrasound for my 42 week 2 day gestation baby girl. I was told this was life threatening and we should head straight to the hospital or the baby could die. We were planning a home birth and this seemed to frighten the doctor, and I was under the impression that we were being coerced into hospital to make us birth there. The problems I found with the story the doctor told me didnâ€™t fit with my understanding of problems associated with meconium appearing on an ultrasound.

Title: Diagnosis and management of haemochromatosis
Time: 2012-10-11T04:18:54Z
Location: New South Wales;
Author: the patient
Story: I currently have a venesection every two months, to treat haemochromatosis. The pathology nurses at the centre I attend are wonderful. My current GP is also wonderful, he understands I continue to be plagued by fatigue, and we are trying to find solutions/reasons for this. I am currently monitored by my GP and a gastroenterologist, and see a cardiologist yearly. I was initially diagnosed with haemochromatosis in 2008. I no longer see the GP I saw in 2008 â€“ who did not seem to believe that women developed haemochromatosis and that venesections were not required. This was in spite of the fact that I had a hysterectomy at a relatively early age, which was noted in my medical file. At the time of diagnosis, I was unaware there was such a thing as iron overload, or that it could cause major health problems if left unattended. My major issue is that for so long I felt so unwell and unheard. My fatigue was such that I left my job, which would have been unnecessary had I been diagnosed when I first starting feeling increasing unwell. This in turn made me angry and unbelieving that haemochromatosis as a condition does not receive more attention. I do understand there is debate around the prevalence of actual ill health associated with iron overload. After talking with other people with this condition, it is my belief that some GPs may be unaware of many aspects of haemochromatosis. The good thing is that two younger relatives were consequently diagnosed, and are having venesections. Hopefully this will prevent them developing serious health problems in the future.

Title: Aged Care facility: inadequacy of dementia care
Time: 2012-10-15T21:52:56Z
Location: Jindalee Aged Care Residence;
Author: a volunteer/advocate
Story: I am an advocate for people with families in aged care. I have witnessed and heard of dozens of cases of premature placement in apparent substandard locked dementia units. The most recent that I have witnessed is a facility named Tricare at Jindalee in Brisbane. In my opinion, from what I have witnessed this facility continues to provide poor care to some of its patients, including failing to seek dental care for a patient who was complaining of pain and appeared to have symptoms that needed immediate attention. I think the new Complaints mechanism is toothless to act on many reports. If the nursing home tells the government that they have acted to remedy a problem, the government can do nothing further and they don't seem to follow up to see if the problem is actually resolved. I have written data which confirms this and it is most concerning to me. We will all be old one day or may have someone we love in these circumstances.

Some of the foods included were broccoli and zucchini. Kate took them through the vitamins that were in each food and also spoke about portion size in treats. Only one student out of 18 didnâ€™t eat the food that was cooked however that student did try two of the four dishes. Kate was very encouraging and non-judgemental.

The following morning he was allowed to die with dignity, in a comfortable bed with his family and loved ones around. This is exactly as he had asked - no tubes and interventions when it was time to go... no extending his death ... just ensuring his was comfortable and pain free. In our modern era of health care ... we were grateful that the hospital staff were able to navigate this path with us and honour the wishes as were written in his Advance Health Directive.

Sarah has also assisted us with applying for grants and programs. Whenever we ask for their assistance they are always there to help. They use their bigger networking area to help us and our clients out. I remember last Christmas they helped get one of our clients access to a donation, by putting her in touch with the right people so that she would have some money over Christmas.

Both parents have worked since the age of 12 years, they were successful in supporting son to become a Doctor of Medicine however he passed away 8 years ago unknown causes. This was ironic due to my mother having distrust and fear of the medical world. This was due to her own parents passing at the age of 50 years due to progressive lung disease. Both my parents and grandparents were not able to access the medical needs due to limit finace. I believe my parents would have had better quality of life if the current supports would have been accessable two years ago. My father's medical specilist would cost $800 for three mths, without taking into consideration his daily medical needs. My culture and family history set off my future path thanks to the Closing the Gap program and dedicated workers at Murrumbidgee Medicare Local (Ann Maree Ingram and Karen Ingram).

Location: Wagga Wagga Base Hospital;
Author: the patient
Story: I recently spent a few days in the Wagga Base Hospital and I could not believe that this once proud hospital had deteriorated to such a state. From what I saw the ER was just a shambles with what seemed to me like a lack of space. Some of the nurses looked like robots more intent on their portable computer screens and less focused on comforting and relating to patients. The only relief from ER was a demountable called EMU that takes the overflow from ER which from what I saw was clean but again I experienced no personal care from the nursing staff and it is closed down over the weekend, which I think is a silly arrangement. I eventually went to Ward 3 which was so dirty with cobwebs and dingy rooms not to mention the bathrooms which were in my opinion just deplorable. I only came across one nurse who appeared to show any interest in me and her other patients her name was Sue, who in my opinion showed the qualities of what I believe a caring nurse should have. The operator of the CT scan was wonderful but it looked like the roof was starting to fall in. I do not appreciate having to share a bathroom with male patients, surely these should be separate and with the clutter in the shower (which was full of commode chairs) there was no where to place my personal items. The passage outside my room was also full of wheel chairs and walkers and the passage was cluttered with many trolleys leaving only one lane. As far as hygiene is concerned, what I saw was terrible. I watched 2 nurses change the other bed in my room without disinfecting the mattress and the cleaners did not seem to show any real care in their work, it looked very slap-dash to me. Don't even mention the meals - they are apparently cooked and frozen in Sydney and then transported to WWBH, but when I lifted the lid I gagged so I lived on toast (made by myself) as the meals I received were in my opinion so terrible. Not even toast at breakfast only bread. How do you scramble eggs in Sydney and warm them up in Wagga only to be presented with a grey blob? To me it appeared that all of the staff were dressed the same -I couldn't tell the difference between a wards man and a nurse. Even though I feel the conditions in this aging hospital are so terrible I do not think the quality of nursing should drop - like the nurse who gave me my dinner time medication at 9pm and all she said was that she forgot about me. I was also told by another nurse, who came in at the same time, that I was being moved to another ward, I was not happy but started to gather my things when I heard another voice tell that nurse that they would find someone else. I also didn't like being a couple of rooms away from a patient who apparently had a 24 hour watch and an old gentleman, who appeared to suffer from Alzheimerâ€™s, yelling all day and night. I'm all for the new Mental Health building but what about the other patients? I don't think this hospital can last another 5 or more years until another one is built. Yes I was sick but expected better from this hospital. The hygiene alone was a worry to me and also the lack of genuine care I received from the nursing staff. I could not wait to get out of the place and get home to have a shower in clean conditions and a proper meal.

Story: I have been attending the clinic at the Princess Alexandra Hospital with a chronic lung condition for a few years now. I actually enjoy going as I feel like some of the staff have now become friends. The nurses I have come in contact with are wonderful, the ladies on reception always welcoming and helpful and the medical staff I see are caring and patient and kind when I feel a bit down, though I am usually cheerful. Everyone says hello to me and I feel like I am a person in my own right, not just a patient. However, when I reach the pharmacy, if I have a prescription then things are very different. Some staff there are nice but others seem arrogant and uncaring. I have seen very ill patients left standing while the staff chat in the background. I have been told off by a woman there and made to wait 3 hours before being called to the counter and told I would have to come back another day. I wouldn't recommend this pharmacy to anyone.

Author: the patient
Story: I had been seeing this GP for over a year. As I have some pre-existing health conditions I found that this GP in particular was able to help me which is why I have stayed. I always thought he was really nice to me. However, on one of my last visits I was really upset as there had been a death in my family. This doctor seemed to see that I was very upset so he proceeded to get up and hug me...really tightly. This made me feel really awkward. Then he kissed me on the cheek which made me feel even more uncomfortable. I wanted to leave right then but he was standing in front of the door and told me that he was sorry. I asked him to move from in front of the door. He just stood there saying I was really beautiful and how he just wanted to take me out for coffee. I told him that if he didnâ€™t move from in front of the door that I would stab him with the pen I had in my hand so he moved and I walked out the door. I see him at my chemist and he walks the other way which is very awkward for me. It has also been really difficult for me to find another doctor that understood my specific health conditions.

They provide us with wonderful resources and they also come to us which makes it easy from the parents and their families to access the service. Kate and Judy also come back when needed to follow up on their previous visits. They are good at building relationships with the community. We would be lost without them. What a great service!

Story: I am part of a resource and recovery program and I have worked with Sarah Hienges (a rural primary health nurse from the Murrumbidgee Medicare Local) for 2 years. As part of our Mental Health Program we have been able to get funding so that we can run community groups in Cootamundra. We formed an art group which Sarah comes to and provides health information on different topics. Previous to running this art group there were some people who did not leave their house however it seems that having this art group has changed this. By coming along to these art groups and receiving health information from Sarah I see that many people appear to have developed more self-confidence and have been able to get to know other people. One person who attended this group is now, 2 years later, an art exhibitor at the local tourist office in Young which I think is a great achievement. I also believe that this program has helped decrease the stigma of Mental Health in our community. I wish to thanks Sarah who is organised and always gives feedback and promptly responds to my emails. In my opinion we wouldnâ€™t be where we are now without Sarah.

These symptoms appeared so obvious to me and yet he was told by this GP that he had a throat infection. A few weeks later my brother died. I went to speak to the GP to tell him what he had missed but as soon as I said my brother had died he ran away from me. He ran out of the clinic and took off! Great GP, huh?

Story: Libby is the Primary Health Nurse that comes to our town. I believe her support is invaluable as it allows many people to allay their anxiety by being able to ask her questions that they would otherwise have to go to the doctor for. Groups of women can come together with any concerns and ask her questions and feel heard as Libby really seems to listen to everyone and everyone gets their turn at speaking â€“ enabling them to unload. I personally feel that I would be taking up valuable time and money if I was to have to see the doctor rather than Libby for only information. She also holds tai chi classes which I think is great for me and many other older people as it helps with our balance and can help reduce our chance of a fall. In my opinion having someone like Libby supporting our community helps keeps people in their homes, enabling them to cope better. Without a primary health nurse coming out to us we would have to travel very far as we are 50 miles out of Wagga (Ganmain). Libby gives great advice and support and is exceptionally nice.

Story: My son was seen by a senior staff member in the Paediatrics unit in regards to his behavioural problems. We have been concerned that he may have Autism/ADHD or the like. We were told that our son could not be diagnosed because he was apparently too young. We were also told we should go to parenting courses, which to me implied that the problem was our parenting. Our son was two and a half and is progressively getting worse. He is now almost four. We know of other parents whose children have been diagnosed with Autism younger than this, so we believe that for sure that our son could be diagnosed. We moved to Caboolture for about six months and got in contact with a playgroup for Autistic children. The staff there shared our concerns and seemed to agree that he shows the signs of being Autistic. We were placed on a waiting list to see a paediatrician in Caboolture but had to relocate to Gin Gin for family reasons and were unable to get into see the paediatrician at Caboolture. We have tried speaking to our GP about it, but something appears to have happened where he is unable to operate as a GP in Australia due to his training. No other local GP seems to be willing to accept us I think because they have had to take over our doctors patients and no longer are able to see anyone else. We feel very alone and donâ€™t know what to do in order to get our son the help he needs.

Story: 6 months ago I passed out at home and was taken to Ipswich Hospital (QLD), I spent 6 days there having test after test. Firstly Iâ€™d like to say that the staff I saw were excellent, friendly, and informative and seemed ready to help in any way. I thought the care I received was outstanding. The food appeared to be carefully thought out, as it seemed to cater across the board for all diets. The only complaint I have is night time -the noise there was awful and I found it was impossible to sleep as there were constant alarms going off, clunking of staff shoes, constant crashing of fire doors, staff changing shifts, and after 4 nights of this I was cranky and didnâ€™t care. The last time I was in hospital I was 13yrs, Iâ€™m now 60yrs,back then a good nightâ€™s sleep was looked on as part of the healing process, if I had known this beforehand I could have prepared for the noise and had a much more pleasant stay.

Story: I (60 year old) recently suffered a heart attack in Toowoomba (QLD). The acute care and treatment I received from my local GP, the Toowoomba Hospital, Queensland Ambulance and the PA Hospital in Brisbane was excellent and I am most grateful for the quality of the health care I received (I was stabilised in Toowoomba on a Monday, transferred to the PA on the Tuesday for an angiogram, fitted with one stent on Wednesday and back home for recuperation on Thursday). However there we're a couple of 'patient journey' issues with my experience. First, I was not told by the Toowoomba Hospital team that the transfer to Brisbane was one-way only and I had to make my own arrangements to get home on Thursday. Fortunately I had family in Brisbane who could help, but I thought it was poor to not know until I was on my way to Brisbane in the ambulance! Second, I had a three hour wait after discharge from the PA on Thursday morning while the hospital doctors and pharmacy sorted out my meds.. And I wasn't alone. Three of us were waiting in a public waiting room at the hospital for our meds! While I do not believe these are clinically critical issues, and at no time did I think my health care was compromised, I feel that an otherwise positive patient experience was soured a little by poor communication and coordination of service delivery.

Title: Type 2 Diabetes: The Genetic Trojan horse in HbA1c testing
Time: 2013-01-30T04:58:38Z
Location: South Australia;
Author: the patient
Story: I have been a type2 diabetic for 27 yrs. I was hospitalised with ketoacidosis for 7 days. I was referred to an Endocrinologist, who told me to come back every 2 yrs. In the late 90's I began to notice high BGLs and would go to the GP, who would send me for a 12hr fasting HbA1c (A1c for short) test. Due to moving house etc I saw quite a few GPs. All told me that my A1cs were great control. When I asked for a referral back to Endocrinologist I was told I did not need one! As I got more lethargic, I couldnâ€™t understand why I was continuously being told that I had great control. I decided to join a 5yr research program for diabetics at a major hospital, hoping that I would get some answers. On 2 occasions I was finger pricked with an A1c meter (which I did not know existed. I was told that I wasnâ€™t a diabetic and I was refused my appointments with the Hospital Dietitian. At the time I taught Accreditation Standards. I eventually lost my job as I could not concentrate and was totally lethargic. In 2008 I met a young GP who I believed was puzzled with my great A1cs results. I asked him for a referral to an Endocrinologist which he agreed to. On relating my experiences, he brought out 2 meters. I recognised the BG Meter but not the A1c meter. I remembered he explained that my 12hr fasting A1cs was in fact for Blood chemistry not A1c as this can be done at any time. It took all of 10secs to finger prick me and it seemed that he immediately saw that the readings did not relate. I was then given a Fructosamine test which verified his diagnoses that I had Variant Haemoglobin or the 'Umbrella' term Haemoglobinopathies. I had just accepted these A1c tests on 'face value' as I had never been taught about the chemistry of A1c as HbA1c is generally referred to as the 'Gold Standard Test' in Diabetic management. In my experience (based on this test) my GPs have either put me on medication/insulin or left as is due to 'great control'. Putting my Quality Assurance 'hat on' I back tracked to find why it was not picked up. In my opinion I believed it was not picked up because the lab report, showed on page 1--- A1c --4-0 and 4.1 and underneath a table '7% the Goal' --- less than 6 non diabetic level however on page 2 my fasting glucose was 15.5 mmols. To me it appeared that my GP had only been reading page 1 when I went for my A1c results. The GPs I have spoken to did not know of the confounder of A1c testing. The nurses and endocrinologist I was in contact with at the hospital trial had used A1c meters in isolation and declared me a non-diabetic. Heamoglobinopathies are rare in caucasins within Australia but are somewhat more common in people from the following ethnic backgrounds (which I fit into as a Scot with Irish ancestry):- Southern European (Greek; Italian; Maltese; Cypriot; Spanish), Middle Eastern; African; Chinese; South East Asian; Indian Sub-Continent; Pacific Islander; New Zealand Maori; South American and some Northern Western Australian and Northern Territory Indigenous communities as quoted in a letter I received from the Minister for Health in South Australia. It is my belief that Diabetes educators, GPs and nurses etc. in the Diabetic area should be made aware of Haemoglobinopathies as I think that those who â€˜fall through the netâ€™ of A1câ€™s â€˜exception to the ruleâ€™ could, like me, not be medicated correctly, which in my case lead to earlier complications. From my experience I think that a diabetic is only as good as their self-management skills will allow so I would suggest other diabetics write down their results of A1c tests and then compare them with their BGLs and see if they match, then ask their GP for a Fructosamine test.

In addition to that, this hospital appears to be very short staffed.

Title: Discharge summary and patient records at Fremantle Hospital and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital
Time: 2013-02-08T04:18:41Z
Location: Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital;Fremantle Hospital / Accident & emergency;
Author: the patient
Story: In 2007 I discovered I was deficient in Lutinising Sensitive Hormone which affected my production of available testosterone. I was given testosterone injections to help with this. Later in 2010, a few days after one of my regular injections I had a brief episode of altered consciousness (a syncope). On this occasion I was admitted to Fremantle E D where I felt I was treated as a drunk. I hung around for a while and then I walked out. I visited my own Dr and discovered that I had a very large aneurysm so an internal investigation was planned. Throughout my experiences with the Neurosurgery unit at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital it was and still is, in my opinion, quite exemplary and I would highly recommend it. However before this internal investigation took place I had another brief syncope, again a few days after my regular injection. I visited Fremantle E D again to satisfy the concerns of others. Results of the investigation showed a calcified mass. In one professional's opinion it was untreatable and must have been there at least five years to be calcified like it was. Given my advanced age we agreed the best course for me would be to let nature take its natural course to which I was happy to agree, however, I feel I am being stopped from doing so by intervening attitudes from other agencies. Later in 2011 I was given a new prescription of testosterone injections as my usual one was unavailable. It was soon clear to me that this medicine was infinitely stronger than what I was previously prescribed. A few days later I was cycling and when I went down I knew I was going, I just melted onto the ground. All the time I was in SCGH general medicine unit I remember asking the doctors that I think I needed a blood spec to check my Calculated Free Testosterone. I feel I was treated like a joke. I did not see any reference to my hormone deficiency or the resulting necessity for Testosterone Deficiency Therapy. This is despite my pleadings to prove I was, in my opinion, toxic on my new medication. However, I feel all my pleadings were ignored. As soon as I was settled into the ward bed several doctors, one at a time, came in and started asking me questions. After the fourth or fifth doctor came in the nurse came over I asked which one was my doctor - I was told by the nurse that she had never seen any of them before. The next morning more doctors turned up. There were three more when I was moved to another ward. With after thought I really should have planned to call security because I believed my privacy and security were compromised. I remembered there were eight or nine doctors in total that visited me, which made me feel like a freak. Unhappily in my experience most doctors I have encountered, since my aneurysm was discovered, seem to want to get my head into a C T scanner to have a look. My fear is that I could be a passenger in a friendâ€™s car and be involved in an accident, unconscious and when I get brought to the hospital the doctor would see my name and phone radiology to get them to warm up the CT scanner. I could find myself coming around with my head in a CT scanner and an untreated broken leg. I believe that my initial diagnosis for my admission was influenced by my previous discharge summary at Fremantle Hospital ED. I have been told that all medical staff refer to past records to establish knowledge of a prospective patient which is precisely why I want my records corrected. I have written evidence to support why I want my records changed. However I have been unsuccessful so far. All I really started out for was to get a couple of documentary changes that could suggest an alternative possibility for my rare syncope. I have written to the consultant at SCGH about correcting my discharge summary. I feel my letter was totally ignored. Even though Advocates and hospital spokespersons, in my experience, have been reluctant to put anything in writing (preferring the phone) I have accumulated a fistful of supporting documents. My computer competence is very limited. I really do need advice on where to go now. Thank you for listening.

Title: Gynaecologist appointment in Brisbane
Time: 2013-02-14T13:03:45Z
Location: Gynaecologist (Wickham St, Brisbane);
Author: the patient
Story: I went to see a gynaecologist in Wickham Terrace, Brisbane, as I needed to have a hysterectomy ASAP. This had already been decided at the Royal Brisbane and Womenâ€™s Hospital, but I wanted to go private to get it done sooner. I explained to the gynaecologist that my very enlarged uterus was pressing on my ureter causing urine to back up, resulting in hydronephritis and a hydroureter and high blood pressure. The gynaecologist questioned if this was because of the uterus, and seemed to think it may be because of a kidney stone. Even though I appreciated the exploration of all possibilities, I felt the gynaecologist didnâ€™t believe what I was saying, even though the hospital had already done extensive tests, and determined it was the uterus. In the end, the gynaecologist agreed the uterus had to be removed (for a few other reasons anyway), and a surgical appointment was made for a few weeksâ€™ time. I said I didn't want to wait that long, as my blood pressure was very high. The gynaecologist then checked my BP which was very high, and told me to relax and checked again in a minute. After 5 minutes, it was only slightly lower but still very high. I explained that this was not uncommon with me recently, but the gynaecologist commented that I was just anxious! ! ! ! ! ! I asked if there was any way it could be done sooner (I am very worried about permanent kidney damage), and I was told that a few weeks was a good deal! I left feeling extremely angry - I felt I was not listened to and that my concerns were not addressed.

Author: the patient
Story: Recently I experienced pain in my side, and, after phoning 13Health, went to Prince Charles Emergency Department late in the night. They proceeded to do blood tests, urine tests, physical examination, and an abdominal CT scan. I then saw the Doctor talking on the phone, and I overheard her talking about my case, so I tried to eavesdrop as much as I could. Good thing I did, because I was told nothing. About an hour later, I was told by a nurse that I was going to be transferred to the Royal (Brisbane and Womenâ€™s Hospital). I told her that I hadn't been told anything. Apparently, they had decided the problem was gynaecological, which would be treated at the Royal. I really think I should have been kept up to date with everything and that the patient should be told first.

I do think more promotion of the operating hours is needed and a sign to indicate the medical centre is open. If I didnâ€™t check last time I wouldnâ€™t have known it was open due to lack of any indication or signage.

Story: Assessment tools are not my favourite. Dividing my life into 10yr increments (schematic) helped me recall significant (some sad/painful) life events in detail, giving a road map feel to my recollections. I was assisted to think up some examples that changed my negative core beliefs (ncb) about myself. Two surfaced during a self-esteem group. I now understand these (ncb) were never true. I have become â€˜in touchâ€™ with my â€˜inner mumâ€™, a sassy gal who comes up with sensible â€˜self-talkâ€™ for my own re-parenting. My therapistâ€™s availability and continuity for all of my sessions has helped with my severe rejection issues. I still feel I could benefit from more therapy, but at present the continuity of visits to one therapist, schematic memory exercises and facing the truth, I believe have all contributed to the therapy being helpful. I have been able to become very aware of my strong survival instincts and resilience. Some earlier discussions for which Iâ€™ve felt guilt, I now realise were good ones made by my inner â€˜sassy gal' mum re: survival. I now believe a positive role model and grandmother shines even brighter after therapy. Assessment tools I do not like.

Story: I recently had a hysterectomy at North West Private Hospital. I thought the surgeon, Dr Martin was excellent, as were nearly all of the nurses who looked after me, especially Michelle, Shelley, Emma, Judy, Leanne and Debbie. There was one nurse who didnâ€™t seem as competent or professional as the others. Because of complications (paralytic ileus), I had an extended stay, but at all times I felt totally cared for. As I was in extreme pain at times, the nurses did whatever they could to ease the pain.

Title: I found the response from the National Health Practitioner Ombudsman to be very threatening
Time: 2013-02-28T23:57:32Z
Location: South Australia;
Author: a volunteer/advocate
Story: As a health consumer advocate I have had 2 series of contacts with the National Health Practitioner Ombudsman - NHPO. This is the authority to complain to if a person is not satisfied with the action the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency â€“AHPRA. The first contact was a couple of years ago; the consumer rang the NHPO on several occasions wanting to talk to someone regarding her concerns with AHPRA. All she got was a recorded message. During early October 2010 she emailed the office with her concern. She received an automatic response informing her staff would be returning on the 1st Nov. When she had not heard by the 15th of November she again emailed. An abrupt response was received, which did not even address her, or have any closing niceties. The email indicated nothing had been done to resolve her complaint. 2 weeks later she received a written response informing her AHPRA had told the Ombudsman they had the right to decide to exclude her, and that was the end of the matter. So when another person I was assisting needed to lodge a complaint re AHPRA I was cautious. This personâ€™s husband had died as a result of alleged poor care from particular registered health professionals, so I did not want her to go through another process that could add to her grief. I too rang the NHPO on several occasions, receiving a recorded message. Eventually I decided to leave a message with my phone number and waited for the call to be returned, it never was. I then emailed asking when the office would be open so I could ring and speak to someone. The response informed me to fill in the on line complaints form or leave a message on the phone. I emailed back asking when I could speak to someone. The response explained that they worked part time and were very busy and to fill in the on line complaints form. Neither of these emails had the normal courteous opening nor closing greetings. I then sent back a stronger email explaining I was an advocate and wanted to speak to someone about how a complaint may be handled and that I was appalled with their practice especially when their web site states one of their values is accessibility. I found the response to be very threatening. This time it did have an opening greeting but no closing remark such as yours sincerely, regards ... Our health system is dependent on good regulation of registered health professionals. How can we have faith in the registration authority if some staff at the authority above them behave so badly.

Title: Care from Qld Ambulance officers and Ipswich GP After Hours Clinic
Time: 2013-03-04T05:19:29Z
Location: Queensland Ambulance Service;Ipswich GP After Hours Clinic;
Author: a service user
Story: We were booked in to go to the after hours doctor but approx. 30 mins before the appointment my wife decided she felt worse and told me we had better call an ambulance. She had taken her blood pressure about an hour before the appointment and found the systolic blood pressure to be 189! She also had a massive headache and in the previous week had had both diarrhoea and constipation. Two ambulance officers arrived soon after we called. One of them, Brian was caring, kind and respectful. I found the other officer to be rude, obnoxious, unkind and disrespectful. He didnâ€™t give his name. He wanted to know why they had been called, even though the symptoms above had appeared to have been outlined to him. He was full of, what I thought were hurtful remarks and said â€˜youâ€™ve called the ambulance because of a headache?? â€™. We were also told by that ambulance officer that they would take us to the hospital just to keep us happy, anything to keep us happy. I followed the ambulance in my car to the Ipswich General Hospital. Brian was with my wife and booked her in at the Emergency Department (I didnâ€™t see the grumpy officer again). Approximately two hours later we were still waiting so I went up to the Ipswich After Hours GP Clinic and found we could still go there (I had to cancel our previous appointment). There we found Dr Myles who kindly and respectfully treated my wife for her extremely high blood pressure, constant headache and other symptoms, in contrast to the â€˜rough and gruffâ€™ handling we had received from one of the two ambulance officers. It makes me doubtful whether Iâ€™ll ever call the ambulance again.

Title: I have been given no real information about how my treatment fits in with my ability to work
Time: 2013-03-05T19:51:10Z
Location: Charters Towers Health Service;
Author: the patient
Story: A little over ten years ago I began falling after a cartilage repair. X-rays showed a mass reported as a trabecular. I had my knee checked some years later by an orthopaedist after difficulty walking. In 2010 I fell and couldnâ€™t get up and was told to bed rest for a month. Right Knee was painful. Right leg was weak. Happened again in 2011 and 2012 and a bakers cyst was found to have occluded the popliteal vein and was pressuring its accompanying nerve. Mid 2012 I was operated on and I gained a major increase in mobility immediately as well as a much better outlook. Late 2012 right leg ballooned and a DVT was found. The warfarin I was given was rough to begin with. Made me very depressed. I was told that this happens and, like the nurse said, it passed quite rapidly. In my opinion it is a hard medication to live with but it does seem to do the job. I have noticed that I can walk up stairs unaided and ride a bike to a standstill and increase pressure on the pedals and the bike moves again. I could not do this previously. I have been given no real information about how my treatment fits in with my ability to work. There are a lot of times when I donâ€™t feel well and if I do any work (even cleaning up) I will sleep for 3-4 hours after. This isnâ€™t me. Antidepressants donâ€™t appear to improve things for me but pain meds do. I have been diagnosed with chronic pain syndrome and I think the problem may be the cyst. From what I have read Epidemiological studies point to raised deep vein pressure as causing all kinds of vein damage. I can get no real answer to getting back to being productive. I don't blame the Charters Towers Hospital as I believe they are dangerously under resourced and in the present climate there may be little they can do. From what I have experienced there seem to be procedural problems which indicate to me that some people are working to an impossible schedule. I have been waiting for 5 years to get my cyst fixed and I am told it should occur in 12 months. Unless a surgeon can tell me otherwise I would like that done ASAP under the public system as I don't have the resources to do it privately. Maybe I will have a pulmonary embolism and expire before they need to do anything. As I am writing I am experiencing pain on inspiration rapid heart rate and I feel lousy. I started my working life as a trainee nurse and was a pharmacist before I got sick so I believe I know what happens in the current situation. I would rather die than be labelled a hypochondriac!

Story: My elderly mother was taken by ambulance to the QE hospital because she had a nasty fall, she has advanced osteoporosis and severe scoliosis of the spine. I arrived at the hospital approximately 30 minutes later and my mother was extremely uncomfortable not only because she had hurt herself in the fall but because of her back it is physically impossible for her to lie flat on her back. I asked for a pillow so that she could be more comfortable lying on the stretcher as we had already been told it could be an 8 hour wait as she wasn't urgent, the request for a pillow was denied because of the threat of theft. Apparently it is policy to not provide pillows because they are being stolen...really! You have to walk past security to exit the emergency department I would have thought a pillow would be a little difficult to hide. After an extended wait we left and went to our own GP, that way my mother actually got to see a doctor and receive an xray all within 3 hours. We didn't opt for that option first because she couldn't breathe at the time of the fall which was quite alarming requiring immediate attention.

Title: Taking my toddler to Geelong Emergency after an unknown bite
Time: 2013-03-08T04:12:33Z

Author: a parent/guardian
Story: My 2 year old was bitten by something. Her head was swollen up to 3 times its normal size and she could barely see through her eyes. We went to Geelong emergency. There was less than 10 people in the waiting area. 3 of which were children. Triage was quick. The lady seemed to do nothing but take my child's temperature. We were asked to wait in the children's room. After waiting almost 2 hours I asked if we could have some Panadol for my child. 15 minutes later I had to ask again for Panadol. After 3. 5 hours of waiting we were taken into an area that appeared not to be paediatric for her to be examined. She was given something which only after prompting what it was a number of times was I told it was an antihistamine. Then the staff put a number of patches with what I thought was anesthetic cream so as to draw blood to check if there was a poisonous bite. We were told it would take less than an hour to take affect. We were then asked to go wait outside in the waiting room. After an hour and a half of waiting we asked at the reception what was happening and had to explain the whole story of our already 5 hour ordeal to another staff member and then after 15 minutes that staff member seemed to literally tear the bandages off my toddler's skin and leaving what appeared to be marks that remained for 4 days later. In the end I had to tell the staff member to stop and took the remaining bandages off myself so that they wouldn't hurt her as I assumed it did. The staff member appeared to really annoyed that we had asked for help. After 1 hour we were called in to take the blood test. This time it was what I assumed to be in the paediatric area. Every other bed in the area was taken up by non children patients. By this time there was 6 other children in the waiting area. After the blood was taken we were asked to wait another hour for the results and again were told to go wait in the waiting room. After 1. 5hours we queried what was happening. Only from this did someone actually go and look up our records to see if the results were in. My understanding was that the results had some in after 30 minutes. We were called back in the same room (which I felt had not been cleaned since we had the blood test as all the equipment and rubbish was still there) and given a prescription for Claritin. Over 7 hours in emergency for something I can buy over the counter which did not bring down her swelling at all. In the end we went home feeling really disappointed and upset over our treatment.

Story: This is a little old story but I am assured by some people working at Liverpool Public Hospital that little has changed since. I severed my index finger making breakfast on a dreadful morning in 2011 for which I had to go to this hospital. After sitting in outpatients for over 4 hours, I was finally seen by a GP who advised me that the cut looks too severe and I will have to see a surgeon. The surgeon arrived a couple of hours later to inform me that I had cut an important nerve and will need to undergo a surgery requiring the plastic surgeons. And that I would have to come back the next day. I understood this and left home with some pain killers on the way. I arrived at the hospital as advised the next day and was sent to the waiting room. I waited the whole day and was told at the end of the day that I will have to return the next day and I complied. I returned the next day and was again seated in the waiting room and the waiting began. I waited until 5PM and realised the bad news that I would not be operated on that day either. I dug my feet deep and said I would not budge unless I am treated. I refused to go home despite the pleas from the waiting room staff and the surgeon. Taking defeat the nurse in-charge of the area organised a bed for me and I was admitted for another 24 hours until finally at 8: 30PM the following day I was informed that my lucky day has arrived. I was operated on that night and luckily there was no gangrene or any other complications. Some staff even found such a wait normal and even said I was overreacting.

She took all of the standard steps for being away from home, such as using up all of her perishable food and making sure her bins were empty and the house was secure. She was told to be at the hospital by 7am, which required my sister to get up at around 5am so that she and her husband could pick up Mum and take her to the hospital on time. The trio dutifully arrived well before the prescribed time and the admission process was commenced, gown on (nerves jumping) as she prepared for a major operation. Then someone said that this Surgeon was actually in Queensland, which supposedly everyone knew as it was in my motherâ€™s notes and questioned why she been booked in at this time. Needless to say, my Mother was in tears, my sister was also very distressed and my brother-in-law was very angry. There are signs all over the hospital about the safety of the staff and violence will not be tolerated, but I can understand in these circumstances if someone was hurt; no one was. The good in this story is that the 4 hours spent at the hospital a few days earlier had been full of confidence about the procedure, my mother met all of the staff involved and my sister even asked the question regarding the fact that this was to be a long weekend and "will everyone be here? " It could have been better if someone in the group had noticed in the "notes" that the Surgeon was going to be away, so there was little point in making any arrangements for the day in question. This would have moved the delay, forward by one week and I might not be posting this message. There can be few feelings about the 'care' because none was given. The whole family, however, feel some fairly strong feelings against the medical team involved with this "circus". I find it difficult to believe that ensuring that the surgeon is available is the first thing that is performed when scheduling surgery for the following day. I am sure that there are many logical reasons that could be offered in relation to this 'stuff up', but how will my Mother ever be compensated for the emotional grief that has been endured as a result of this day? What sort of apology will be sent to my sister and her husband for all of the hard work that they have done in preparing for this day? We could all understand if a more urgent case arose between setting the time for the surgery (Thursday afternoon) and the time of the surgery (Friday morning), but to forget that the surgeon is away is, in my opinion, inexcusable. I do not begrudge the surgeon the opportunity to take time off, but the whole staff apparently knew the surgeon wasn't going to be there and yet no one appeared to do anything about it. I think this is disgraceful!

Story: I was admitted last year, suspected of having pneumonia and suffering a stroke. I was unable to get out of bed to go to the toilet and soiled the bed several times despite repeated requests for a bedpan. At one stage my sister virtually carried me to the toilet down the hallway. My lips were cracked and bleeding and my mouth was full of ulcers but I was given no medication or relief. I was left in a corridor after returning from tests as someone else had been put in the cubicle and then my sister and I were yelled at by a doctor for not being in my cubicle as I was 'highly contagious' (although no-one could tell me why). I was eventually put in an isolation ward with no clock, the TV didn't work and was told I couldn't have a radio brought in and that it was too much trouble for me to use the phone. When I rang the bell for help to go to the toilet I was told I should just unhook my drip and go by myself. The orderly who brought my food did not wear a mask or gloves. Visitors were given different instructions - some had to wear a mask and some were told it didn't matter. I felt severely dehydrated but my tube came out several times. The first time it was out from 5- 11. 30pm before someone answered my call and my temperature spiked again. I was not washed nor given a shower for the 6 days I was in hospital as I could not do it myself. There was blood on my sheets and on my gown but neither were changed. I was not given a menu and was brought toast and vegemite every morning despite having huge ulcers throughout my mouth. I was sent home without discharge notes by a doctor I had seen for the first time 5 minutes before, despite not being able to move my left leg. I believe the report my doctor eventually received (after several phone calls) contained lies such as I had received physiotherapy and improved, when no-one had been near me. When I was on yet another ward, my tube came out again and I was bleeding but the nurse was on what sounded to me like a personal phone call trying to track down 'Fifty Shades of Grey' so I had to wait. The patient in the next bed (who I believe had cancer) got out of bed and helped me to clean myself up. I wrote a letter of complaint to the SA Health Minister and never received a response. If I can help it, I will never go back to FMC again, I thought it was a nightmare.

Author: the patient
Story: I've had many dealings with this hospital and not all of them good. I had surgery early 2012 and after a few weeks of being at home and getting my dressings changed the nurse noticed that the wound was getting deeper and so I decided to go to my GP to get it changed, the GP's nurse pulled the packing out and all this fluid started pouring out. They went through so many gauze packets and they appeared really concerned. So I went to the emergency department and explained why I was there, I still had to wait a while but I when I finally got in they had an intern doctor check up on me, and well I know enough to know exactly what the fluid was that was coming out of my surgical wound. It was dried blood but still having an intern emergency doctor tell me that he needs to go and get a senior doctor because sometimes in the surgery heâ€™d had they can stuff it up and puncture the bowel and that the stuff coming out of a wound was faeces, was not comforting. The senior doctor confirmed it was de-oxygenated blood (dead blood, real dark red in colour) but couldn't work out why it was coming out.... Turns out an internal stitch had broken.... my body had to heal itself, gradually it healed over and stopped leaking. I've also been rushed there for having extremely low blood sugar, to which the emergency responders gave me glucose solution to remedy it. So when I arrived at the QEH ED the staff there were told this, and took my blood but because I had a high sugar level due to the solution but they wrote in my charts that I had had a hyperglycaemic episode, I think that is utterly stupid especially since these staff were told by the people who brought me in and by me countless times. This hospital always seems to have a full emergency department. I've seen beds everywhere from people being brought in, in ambulances and not being seen to at all. And when I get into the ER to be seen there appears to be heaps of free beds and space, so I think it may be a staff issue. Also I believe I was bullied into my surgery by the general surgeons there, don't sign the form unless you are 100% sure. I will give praise to one young male surgeon I saw late 2011. I was in agony and my GP sent me straight to the QEH, I was greeted by a very nice general surgeon who made me feel like I mattered, my pain mattered and that he would fix me up. When I was in the surgical waiting area on the gurney he came to see me (in my experience usually they do not) and assured me he would look after me. He was there when the anaesthetist was trying to get my pain under control before putting me under, to which he then again said to me don't worry I've got you. Such good people skills, and to someone like me, who is frightened of surgery, he seemed to care and made me feel that he was more than qualified to help and for a surgeon he was the nicest one I've ever met at the QEH. Do not lose this surgeon QEH as I believe he is one of a kind! The memory of his kindness and his personality made that surgery one of the most comforting ones. Surgeons take note! In my opinion and experience just a smile, a joke and some kind words can make a patients day.

Story: I'd like to say that I visited Modbury Hospital for the first time ever in 2012 and I found the care that I received to be a major step up from the hospital I'd been too all my life, or well since I was technically not at the age to attend "the womens and childrens". I just wish to say that the emergency doctor was professional and kept me informed, I was seen in a timely fashion and the staff got the general surgeon down to assess me pretty quickly. The nurses I saw were diligent and attentive and the general surgeon I saw I felt had a soul, she was a very nice lady who appeared to take her job seriously and seemed to listen to what I wanted and my concerns and really worked around me. I avoided general anesthetic because it makes me ill, so I had a small surgery via local and she really took care of me. And the post surgical care was awesome! She wanted to keep seeing me in clinic until the wound had healed properly and really put on a caring front. So I'd like to say thank you: )

Story: I had a horrible condition that affected my mouth. It was the most painful experience of my life and I looked horrible. I had been crying day after day and almost suicidal. I was in the RAH (Royal Adelaide Hospital) while they tried to figure out what it was. The nurses and doctors I saw seemed to have no empathy at all, I felt like an inanimate object. The worst part was a doctor brought in a whole group of med students to stare at me without even asking if I was okay with it - which I wasn't! I was at my all time lowest, and having these strangers all glaring at me was horrible: -( I left with a very negative impression of the RAH. I think the employees I saw there really need to imagine being in their patients shoes and try to make their stay a nice one.

Author: the patient
Story: I broke my leg skiing and was flown home late 2012. On the advice of my local GP, my mum took me straight to Bendigo Health's emergency department. I thought the staff in emergency were great. I was admitted to the orthopaedics ward as there were no beds available at the private hospital that night (there is also no emergency department at the private hospital). Before being admitted, the ward clerk indicated that if I couldn't get a private room, I'd get a private ward. That didn't happen. The ortho registrar on duty had said I could use a private surgeon if I wanted, or he would operate the next day. That night I couldn't even get a spare pillow to put under my broken leg and was told to raise the bed using the controls. Unfortunately the bed raise at your knees meaning my broken leg was then pointing down, making it worse. I ended up sleeping with no pillow so I could prop my leg up with what I had. The next morning, the ortho registrar asked if I had decided about private surgeon. I had one name of someone who might have been working, as it was Christmas holidays and everyone seemed to be away. I gave the ortho registrar this name, but said I hadnâ€™t spoken to him yet. He said he would ring. Next thing I know, I'm taken off the surgery list for the day, and I'm staying at Bendigo health in a 4 bed "dorm" until surgery Wednesday (it was Monday..) I was told there was no way I could be transferred to the private hospital, or have my surgery there (I'm a fully covered private patient and have been for years). This started an argument between me and the ortho registrar, who proceed to yell at me. I asked repeatedly why if I chose to use a private surgeon I had to wait til Wednesday and why he had just taken me off the list for that day (had I been given a choice of Monday or Wednesday surgery, I would have picked Monday, without caring who did it).He insisted he had explained all of this to me in the emergency department the night before, and again at rounds (he had not, and my mum was with me to confirm.). I told him I wasn't staying where I was, as I had no sleep, was sharing a room with very elderly and sick patients, had private insurance. To my knowledge there were beds available at the private hospital. He yelled at me and to be honest I can't remember exactly what I said, but I was crying and upset, and he yelled at me to stop crying or he wouldn't help me. I rang my GP who agreed to see me straight away, and told the hospital I was self-discharging. No idea what happened but 10mins later, Bendigo health agreed to transfer me to the private hospital. However I felt I was forced to sign the â€˜discharge against medical adviceâ€™ paperwork (for a transfer they arranged). Also, to my knowledge, no transfer paperwork was sent to the private hospital, including drug charts (I was on some pretty strong pain killers..). The private hospital was amazing and the same surgeon, who I was told apparently couldn't operate until Wednesday, operated on my leg Monday afternoon at the private hospital. There were some nurses on the ward who I thought were nice, but the others I saw seemed to be full of attitude and made me feel like I was putting them out for being admitted late in the afternoon/evening. It was after 7pm when I got to the ward, having spent 4ish hours in emergency getting x-rays, ct's etc. I wasn't offered dinner (I wouldn't have eaten it anyway, but it would have been nice to be offered). Mum went and got me McDonald's. It was one of the nurses who I felt forced me to sign the â€˜discharge against medical adviceâ€™ paperwork, fortunately I had enough wits about me to cross part of it out and write in â€˜transferâ€™, she did not appear to be happy about it.. I couldn't tell you her name as there were no introductions at any point which at the private hospital, happened anytime a nurse entered my room and made such a positive difference.

My room was next to the nurses stations and I heard everything and it was worst at the night time. The only time I the nurses was when I buzzed. I was a first time mother and had no idea what I was doing and I needed all the help I could get and thought being there would be the best place. I though what a load of rubbish. Even if one of the nurses gave the time of day just to explain things I beleive things would have been better. I only stay one night due to this because I felt like I was a number and not a person.

Story: Hi, I have been receiving treatment for breast cancer at the RBH for the past three years. I completed treatment and now have 6 monthly check ups with the surgeon, radiation oncologist and Oncologist. I receive a letter with an appointment time usually for 9am. It is not unusual for me to be still waiting to be seen at 12pm. The quickest time I have been seen by the oncologist was 2 hours past my scheduled appointment time. This is very difficult with a three year old daughter in tow who is very restless after the 1. 5 hour car ride to attend the hospital. I attend 4 other hospitals in Brisbane, Redcliffe and Caboolture for care and this is the only hospital that keeps me waiting longer than 30 minutes. When I question reception staff about the wait times they merely state that the doctors are running late. I think these waiting times for scheduled appointments are totally pathetic. I understand if there are emergencies or urgent cases that need to be seen, but this happens each and every time I attend this hospital. Why can the doctors at the other hospitals regularly run on time or pretty close to it?

Story: When my daughter was taken to ED with a mental health problem she was admitted as an inpatient after being seen by a psychiatric Dr. The problem started when there were no inpatient beds so she stayed in ED from Monday morning until Wednesday afternoon, when she was transferred to Morier Ward at Noarlunga Hospital. From what I saw at no time while in ED did nursing staff talk much to her, not even to ask if she needed to go to the toilet or shower. As she was detained she had a guard and in my opinion they and her visitors treated her better. I was disgusted with the care at Morier Ward. ED at least is an emergency service but Morier is a dedicated Mental Health Ward and the staff we saw seemed to do nothing to help patients. It was like entering the movie 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', with patients appearing to be walking aimlessly around and the staff behind a counter and I saw no interaction. I thought people were sent to these facilities to get help but I think this treatment is guaranteed to distress even more.

Story: Every appointment I went to took 2+ hours for someone to talk to me. Only one appointment was ever under the 2 hours and more than once I sat for close to 4 hours waiting for a booked ante-natal appointment. All of the classes available were booked out for at least the 4-5 months I had left of my pregnancy. After I had my baby I didn't get any consultation for 24hours to show me how to breast feed which I believe heavily influenced the fact that it was done wrong and I couldn't breast feed after a few days an had to put my son on formula. I needed 2 blood transfusions which was fine but it took them 16 hours to get it to me. My blood also weren't signed off on so I had to give a total of three test lots of blood which meant my levels went below 62z. I also noticed I had, what looked to me like an infection before I was discharged. I asked to have someone look at it and was asked if I had herpes as that's what it looked like. The following day I went to my doctor and couldn't sit at all. He sent me to hospital with a suspected peri-anal abcess. I was kept in hospital for three days and put on a 48 hour course of antibiotics and a few other drugs. My birthing experience was lovely and the people I saw were mostly nice but I thought the 'care' and procedures were just off.

Story: In my experience multiple patients, fully assessed by psychiatrists as needing an acute mental health bed, spend many days stuck in the emergency department as no suitable mental health beds are available. Their condition appears to get worse due to noise, continuous light, and little opportunity to sleep. They have to be watched by security guards and or shackled when they are a danger to staff or themselves. I think this is distressing for staff and horrendous for these patients. The behaviour of these patients -as a result of their acute mental illness- can be, in my opinion, disruptive and distressing for other patients

Story: My GP sent a referral about my hip to the Physio Department at Mater Hospital and she also asked for physio treatment and a specialist appointment for me last year. Because I had no answer from that, my GP, to my knowledge, sent the referral three more times and I brought the letter to the department in person too. No answer, not even that they just received the referral or anything like that. The GP sent a new referral again to the Specialist Clinics (Orthopaedic Department and the Physiotherapy too ) more than 5 weeks ago but no answer again. I sent a compliant letter to the Hospital and they sent back an apology, that is all, but no appointment time. From what I know of the Public system it is overloaded, but this is ridiculous. How many times do I have to ask for just a simple appointment? And during this time (half year), I have a strong pain day by day. I don't understand, if the hospital is not able to give me an appointment why don't they send a letter about it and I won't wait for longer, but instead ask for an appointment from another hospital?

The admin officer appeared to be listening to the ambulance officer talking to the triage nurse and asked me to spell my street name three times, then on the fourth time I was agitated and said it quite roughly in which the triage nurse told me to settle down. She then asked what was wrong with my husband that he could not come up to the counter so I explained it, to which the admin officer told me I should have called an ambulance, I then said well I was 10 minutes away do you think an ambulance could have got there sooner than I would have got there.

Title: Maternity care at Warribee Mercy Hospital

Location: Werribee Mercy Hospital / Maternity care;
Author: the patient
Story: My child was born by c-section at Werribbee Mercy. Understandably I was in a lot of pain and had difficulty moving. I wanted a drink of water which I was unable to reach. I buzzed repeatedly for twenty minutes, only to be ignored by the nurses that I could hear out at the desk. When someone eventually did turn up, he was rude and condescending to me. I was upset and crying. He turned around and asked why I was being so petty and emotional and told me that his wife had four babies and didn't carry on like me. I thought this was appalling. Additionally I could have been buzzing because there was something wrong with the baby and I couldn't reach him. Nobody came to my room for twenty minutes! I was told this was because I wasn't assigned to the nurses who were standing at the desk outside. This made the whole experience very upsetting, and I believe contributed significantly to my post natal depression in the months following.

Author: the patient
Story: I was referred to the neurology clinics from another hospital. I have attended Royal Perth more than once in two separate departments, for same incidence with two things wrong. I had broken bones as well. I have been treated well and had excellent care from the hand specialists - excellent above and beyond my expectations there. The nurse I saw was lovely and the doctors attentive and nice. My problem was fixed rapidly and I had many clinic appointments. I had a long wait to see them - too long in my opinion, for broken bones and I think this should be fixed ASAP. The neurology clinic is wonderful place - wish I did not have this neurological condition but the nurses I saw were lovely, Doctors are even more so. I have recommended this hospital, Docotors and clinics to others, who have gone and also from what I hear they further recommend them - if this is happening you know you are in the right place. I have had three separate opinions about this neurological clinic, all from different segments in the community who have all highly recommended this clinic. Thanks to this team at this hospital. I understand my condition more and feel I have support, should I ever need to again. My condition is long term and life threatening and it is nice to know someone is there, should something happen. Previous hospitals were just no help - this one, beyond my expectations. Thanks.

Story: I was admitted to hospital with troubles breathing, I believe I had low O2 stats, a Shunt diagnosed and chest pain. I was admitted under the care of a doctor - I was not well and to my knowledge I had Hemoptysis. The doctor did not come in to see me in the hospital, when I asked them to phone doctor after 1 days, he informed them he would be in the next day - he did not show on the next day either - well, apparently he came in to sign but then left without seeing me. When I complained that it had been 2 days now, in my understanding he told staff that he came to see me but I was sleeping, which, I think, is completely untrue as I had been awake since 1am - I believe he then handed my care to another doctor, whom I had to chase for 2 days as well.

Story: My wife and I recently spent a lot of time at Westmead after she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of Breast Cancer. We really can't say one bad thing about Westmead Hospital, it's cancer staff of the public hospital system. I believe my wife received the best possible medical care that anyone could have asked for. The staff at all times seemed to go out of their way to make sure that both of us were looked after in any way they could. After many surgeries, Chemo and Radiation therapy my wife is now into her 2nd year of remission with no signs of cancer. We both realise that every day we now have is precious and we believe that if it wasn't for Westmead and all their wonderful specialists, surgical and nursing staff, she wouldn't be here today, Thank you Westmead for giving us both more time together.

Location: Noarlunga Public Hospital;Flinders Medical Centre / Trauma & orthopaedics;Women's and Children's Hospital / Paediatric trauma and orthopaedics;
Author: a parent/guardian
Story: My 12 year old daughter dislocated her shoulder late last year . She was taken to Noarlunga Hospital where it was discovered her shoulder continually slips in and out. A referral was made to Flinders orthaepedics for physio and treatment. A week later the shoulder dislocated again at school (while at her desk) and she was readmitted to hospital with no resolution. After six weeks going round in circles at Flinders between physio, X-rays and MRI's she was referred to Women's and Children's as it was determined she would need surgery to fix her shoulder. Throughout this entire time (3 months by then) I consistently requested she be referred to a private specialist as it was not a matter I wanted to drag out in the public system. I think it is simply not fair for a 12 year old to be unable to use their arm effectively for even the simplest of tasks. The advice I received though, was that the best paediatric surgeons were attached to the WCH. We attended the WCH as referred - more than four months after the initial injury. On attending the clinic we were advised that apparantly Flinders made an appointment with the wrong clinic and she was referred to another orthaepedic clinic at WCH. Staff at the time contacted the other clinic and I was assured we would have a consultation at that time. On attending the clinic - where there was only one other patient in the waiting room- we were refused a consultation. I asked when the consultation would be and the staff member refused to give me a time frame. The assessment by the staff member - who in to my knowledge had not consulted with my daughter, nor seen her file, was that she was a non-urgent case and no commitment could be made for her treatment. The current status is I have no appointments for the treatment of my 12 year old daughter with any public health professionals in Adelaide, I have no treatment plan and as a result I have a child who is, in my opinion, unable to effectively participate in her life for an indefinite period. Additionally,I believe the longer this is left, the greater the nerve and muscle damage - therefore the more extensive the treatment will be required. This results in a greater impost on the public health system.

Title: No onsite accommodation
Time: 2013-03-09T20:35:13Z
Location: Royal Prince Alfred Hospital;
Author: a parent/guardian
Story: In 2011 I was visiting Sydney with my son, 17 at the time, and we unexpectedly found ourselves in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. The admission ended up being for 3 weeks. The town I live in is 550kms away from Sydney and the most stressful part of the whole stay was the fact that there is no relative accommodation provided by the hospital on site. On the ward he was first admitted to I was visited by the social worker and effectively told I could not stay with my son and this was also repeated by the Nurse Unit Manager (NUM), in what I thought was a none too pleasant manner I might add and in front of my son. I had to emphatically state that I was going nowhere. He was then moved to the ward appropriate to his condition the next day and to their credit the NUM went out of her way to accommodate me as best she could. Toward the end of the stay I had to seek accommodation elsewhere. The Youth Support Team seemed to fully understood my dilemma and were very sympathetic to it but were unable to do anything about it, Youth Support covers ages 12-24. What I wish to highlight here is the stress that I believe some rural people face when confronted with this sort of situation. Is it not stressful enough to be so far away from home with a loved one that is ill without the outrageous added expenses that can ill be afforded when they find themselves in the city and then needing to find accommodation. Apparently the hospital has some accommodation at Ashfield! They also suggested a couple of places closer but I don't think it is unreasonable that I didn't wish to walk too far late at night. Perhaps a talk to the Youth Support Team could provide some interesting stories that rural people have had to resort to so they could stay in Sydney with their children. I also spoke with other relatives during my stay there and that was the one resounding issue they all seemed to have, the added stress of accommodation and its cost. We had a planned admission a few months later for surgery. I had no desire to fight over my staying in the ward and having time on my side this time I was able to book into in a pub down the road that offered reasonable rates to those that had a relative in the hospital. I wonder how those that make the policies would feel if their child has just had major surgery and they are asking that you stay the night and you have to tell them you can't. On a more positive note I could not fault the care that he received from all the staff, no matter what their role. I do believe however that the administration of the hospital need to take a serious look at the accommodation support provided to rural patients and their relatives.

Author: a parent/guardian
Story: Out of the blue my 18 month old daughter stopped walking and would not stand up anymore. I took her to Sunshine Hospital on two separate occasions within days of each other. After they finished, in my opinion not so subtlety accusing me of injuring my own daughter they did what appeared to be a general examination and determined that she either did not want to walk or that she possibly had osteomyelitis. They did no actual tests and sent me home again stating that it would be 'unlikely' that she had the latter. Even though she had the right symptoms for that diagnosis they did not investigate. After visiting the GP the following day I was urged to take my daughter instead to the Royal Children's Hospital as the GP felt there was something very wrong. We were admitted within a few hours on arriving there where they did bloods, a nuclear medicine bone scan and determined she had Sacroiliitis. She was there for 2 weeks on IV antibiotics and had months of arthritis testing, outpatient clinics and meds. I am still upset that staff at the Sunshine Hospital did no investigation when they suspected it was something serious. I believe my daughter endured days more of pain because of their unwillingness to really look at the problem.

Story: I needed the services of the Emergency department at the Royal Adelaide Hospital for a partially torn Achilles tendon. I was treated by the A & E staff and was seen by the orthopaedic doctor and a half plaster cast was placed on my leg/ankle area. The nursing staff assured me that I would soon receive a outpatient appointment and would be seen in approx. two weeks. I informed the staff that I was a diabetic. The weeks went by and no outpatient appointment was received, phone calls to the RAH were to no avail except promises that I will be put on the system and that they will contact me. I am still waiting. The pain in my left ankle was becoming unbearable and I had to cut off the plaster cast to find that a ulcer the size of a ten cent piece had formed on the ankle. My local GP is now treating my ulcer. I think the Royal Adelaide Hospital records system is in disarray, it seems to me that the system is under resourced.

Author: a parent/guardian
Story: 12 months ago, my son developed a sudden severe bilateral hearing loss. Initially Monash Medical Centre provided us with an excellent prompt service, where he was tested with MRI's, hearing tests and blood work. Unfortunately they were only able to tell us that his hearing loss was permanent and no cause was found. We were then referred to the paediatric hearing loss clinic, where they did genetic testing. We were informed that these tests result would not be available for a further 3 months. That was fully understandable and we made an appointment to coincide with the test results. That follow up appointment never happened as they have cancelled our appointments time and time again since then. We are now not seeing them till mid this year, at which point it will be nearly 18 months after his initial diagnosis. To cut a long story short, my teenage son is frustrated, depressed and eager to know what caused this traumatic loss to his life. Monash have excused the cancellations to funding cuts with apparently no concern for the consequences of how their actions are affecting my son's welfare.

Author: the patient
Story: I have spent years suffering a wide variety of symptoms due to chrone's, and some symptoms that are hard to explain. I had been under the care of a doctor, until recently. I was emotionally and verbally assaulted by this doctor, in front of the whole cube, and all his subordinates, due to the frustrating inability to help explain a long term complaint of severe abdominal spasms, continuous vomiting, and profuse perspiration. This abuse includes comments made by this doctor, and various other staff at the Royal Brisbane, and the Ipswich Hospital, that I'm a drug seeking addict, all my problems are in my head, and that I attend hospital to escape my life. When told by this doctor to go elsewhere, as he had seemed to have his fill of me, I said I already had a referral to the PA and that he was surplus to my requirements, he blew his top and went off even more. I have witnesses to multiple acts of abuse towards me. I've even suffered bruising from nursing staff as they have man handeled me from using showers in ER, as diversion therapy. I believe I've been made the butt end of a long term running joke at the Ipswich ER, due to what I think is a lack of education, and uneducated assumptions about me. This treatment I have received by these hospitals have caused me to give up on any belief that there is any doctor out there that really cares, and will listen, understand, and attempt to help me, and not just worry about how my problems affect their success ratios. I am a decorated war vet, who served without thought of my own health and safety, and now when the effects of my service has caused me great suffering, I feel I am abandoned as a second rate citizen, not worth the effort, and not able to have any quality of life. I have also emailed a doctor at the Ipswich, with a recounting of my woes, as my main antagonists are located there, and have made my life such a misery, that I don't attend any hospital, I have no specialist, pain management, and no GP. I am on my own, in my own private hell, fashioned by the Royal Brisbane Hospital, i.e. the doctor from the Royal Brisbane, and then a select few of senior staff of the Ipswich ER. My quality of life is unbearable at most, and my feelings toward myself are questionable at best, as self-harm sometimes tops my list of remedies. Since I am unable to bring myself to such a cowards end, I'm just left with what I don't know, because it sure isn't a life. Thanks Qld Health and your authorised representatives.

The two main presenters Sara and Kim were very proficient and their manner of presentation was relaxed, but they appeared determined to ensure all participants were included. No pressure was placed on us, but we were encouraged to engage in the classroom format. The shopping tour was well done, with hands on participation. Overall we are pleased we attended, with positive results in our physical assessment. It is a program we would recommend to any person who required a healthier lifestyle.

Story: I was brought in by police due to false reports from neighbors. They had been causing me grief and I already had a support letter from the police to be moved. Anyway Nepean Hospital seem to have a rule about anyone brought in by police is tied to the bed, unbeknown to me as I had never been thru this before. I believe this practice happens because there is no staff designated to that area, so hence I think of it as a form of baby sitting which I think is against the law? the next thing, what I know now, big security men posing like police standing over me while im supposed to be calmed and the people that are supposed to be treating me actually made me feel like I was a pig, like I had done something wrong with 4 security men standing over me while I was supposedly being assessed. The next thing I know im trying to walk away from them, im chased and tied to a bed forcefully by 4 big men and doctors and nurses all participating while im just terrified. It was like being in a horror movie. All this because they have no staff to look after me the way the law says and I wonder why people dont get better. Well I didnt have a major mental illness but am still treated like I do and that left me with PTSD which have been proven. I've had appoligies from the supposed service, so what, I didnt deserve or need this. I wonder how many others are out there?

Why build this hospital when people still have to travel? They have an ultrasound machine at Nhill.

Story: After having 2 children in private hospitals we chose Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital for our third as we specifically wanted a water-birth. Not only did we have great support in that but the follow up care was incredibly good. We had a home visit on days 1, 3 and 5 and then were offered more in-home midwife care but didn't need it. Instead the hospital followed up with a phone call and a referral to family and youth health for ongoing care. We felt so well supported and confident with the excellent care and attention to detail.

Location: Redcliffe Hospital;
Author: a relative
Story: My husband was admitted to Redcliffe Hospital with a very swollen, hot and inflamed foot which occurred over a few hours after going to bed. He was treated for two weeks with steroids for inflammation which they considered was caused by his Crohns disease. After nearly two weeks they then decided to do an asparation of the foot as nothing else was working. I had already requested this on two occasions only to be told he didn't have infection. The results came back as Ecoli. Two washout one after the other were performed to clean out the ecoli, which then also was joined by Golden Staff. He spent 5 weeks in hospital and lost 12 kgs in that time. He came home a very sick, weak and debilitated man. It's now been over three months later and his foot, by their diagnosis, has septic arthritis. No treatment, he was told to go home and try to walk as best he could, or they could wash it out again in the hope of improvement or not, or they could fuse his foot. He lost another 3 kgs after they administered antibiotics after being on a duel Picc line for 5 weeks. The antibiotics tablet form made him so ill he lost another 3 kgs in 5 days. I felt angry and frustrated at the system that did not do better than this. I believe doctors and nurses can only do so much and that the system needs to improve to ensure patients are getting the best possible scenario.

Story: For several months now I have been battling the public health system to get help for my Son. My Son is an alcoholic who has been treated in the PA Hospital Emergency Department on several occasions . My son has also suffered with anxiety and depression for more than 10 years. I believe the alcohol use started because of the anxiety and depression but the alcohol has now taken over. He knows that he needs to go to detox as a starting point in his recovery but his anxiety is out of control and he is literally terrified at the thought of going into Detox. He knows that he could die if he doesn't get help but that help is not going to come if he does not get help with his anxiety. I have tried many times to get him some help from the Mental Health Division at the PA but they refuse to see him until he has been through Detox even though I have repeatedly told them that it is his anxiety that is stopping him going to Detox. Their response has been that he must not really want to give up the alcohol if he doesn't go to Detox. So I am helplessly watching him each day drinking himself into oblivion and he is becoming more and more depressed and terrified about dying but no-one will help.

Author: the patient
Story: On a Saturday evening, my abdominal pain was very severe. I was lucid enough to dial 000 for an ambulance, but not enough to pack a bag. I called three times and the ambulance arrived about midnight. Twenty minutes to the Gold Coast Hospital, then an initial examination and relegation to the waiting area. Some time later another examination and minor pain medication. This was repeated several times until an X-ray and later again some kind of scan. I suppose I lost track of time and of what was going on, but sometime after arriving at the hospital (3hrs) my appendix burst. The operation was carried out approximately 21 hours after my first phone call. I was told later that I had essentially died on the table. Of course I was out of it for much of the time, due to pain and/or pain relievers, but how could I have been left so long for my appendix to burst. I am very grateful (I think) and the doctors and nurses were terrific, afterwards. My question is really; how could diagnosis and the operation take so long and bring me so close to dying? The ambulance guys told me that if I had reported chest pains the urgency would have been greater.

Author: the patient
Story: I fell from my horse late 2012, causing a bad fracture of my hip. The ambulance officers were amazing and the orthopaedic ward was great at Nambour General. I had a gamma nail inserted the day after the accident and everything was going well. The doctors did a good job of piecing the neck of the femur back together but the distal screws didn't go all the way through to the bone on the other side of the femur. The screws had backed out of the bone by the time I went in for the first outpatients check-up at six weeks and had a x-ray taken. The doctor that saw me after three hours of waiting said not to worry about it and to come back in six weeks. The loose screws were causing considerable discomfort but I went back in six weeks and was put on the waiting list to have the screws removed. It is now nearly four months later and I am still waiting to have the screws taken out. I think that if the screws had been the correct length to start with they wouldn't have backed out and I feel that my pain and the prolonged healing process aren't being considered at all. Every time I bend my leg, to walk or sit, I feel the screws moving in the muscle above the knee.

Story: I was recently taken from my home by ambulance to the hospital after a bout of seizures ( I am epileptic). When I came to from these seizures I was unable to form words and was very light sensitive, neither of these usually happen to me post seizure. The ambo's were very kind, as were the nurses. I was in emergency for a few hours where I had the curtain closed and a hat over my face as any light was causing me to see stars. I was then admitted to the neurology ward. The neurology team wished to discharge me two days later as it was a Friday and I would be able to go home under the care of my fiancÃ© and rest, unfortunately for me I was still in a mask as any light was causing severe pain. I advised the team that I was unhappy with this decision and upset that for 2 days nothing had been done other than basic observations, when I thought it was clear something wasn't right as this was very unusual for my seizures. I was advised that I didn't have to like the decision and that I was being discharged and that history shows that my side effects go away over time. Yes my side effects go away over time but my usual side effect is weakness down my right and understandable drowsiness. I was shocked and upset by their decision and requested to speak to my own neurologist, I was advised that he was away so I requested anyone else from neuro, this request was denied. I cried and I felt they decided that the best way to deal with this was to close my curtain and the door to my 4 patient room. Eventually one of the team came back and advised that they would do a CT scan to ensure I didn't have a bleed, just to be safe. After the CT scan was done no one got back to me at all until the Monday morning when I was discharged. By this point I was out of the blackout mask but was still in sunglasses. Today I still sit in a darker than normal lounge & cannot go out into the sun, even when cloudy without my sunglasses on without seeing stars, yet apparently I will recover ok. How is this normal or acceptable? I would however love to say that some of my nurses in the neuro department, in particular Felicity, Penny, Amanda & Kylie were lovely, helpful and considerate of my needs for darkness as much as possible.

Story: My 21 year old daughter has a low body weight (20 kg) due to cerebral palsy with reduced muscle mass. She was admitted via ED to an adult medical ward at Mackay Base Hospital with a febrile illness, ? sepsis and hypoxia. As a result of this placement, I believe she was severely compromised by overdoses of fluid and drugs, which I also believed resulted in pulmonary oedema, multi-organ failure with eventual admission to ICU. It was apparent to me that the staff looking after her did not appear to have the the training or the equipment to deal with a patient her size. On my recommendation, paediatric rescusitation equipment was placed in her room. The paediatric CNC refused to take her and was very unhelpful. The staff looking after my daughter seemed to try hard but were, in my opinion clearly out of their depth. It was at my insistence that the ICU team became involved when it was obvious to me that she was hours from dying. My daughter was placed on life support and it was expected that she would die. Our family live in Brisbane and it was a MAJOR fight to get her accepted to an ICU in Brisbane. I think that the QLD Health rule that 'acceptance to paeds care is solely based on age' should be urgently reviewed. I would strongly recommend that any young adult with a low body weight should also be reviewed by a Paediatrician, especially regarding volumes and doses of fluids and drugs administered. My daughter was eventually (I felt reluctantly) accepted to the Mater Adult ICU who did a fantastic job. She has made a good recovery - despite the dismal prognosis we were given. The eventual diagnosis was influenza. I have no doubt that much of my daughter's deterioration was iatrogenic and I believe this was a direct result of the apparent lack of staff training and the delayed opinion of a paediatric specialist.

Story: When my wife was in Caboolture Hospital late 2012 a community nurse informed me that it had been decided that they were going to send my wife to a transition Care Home. Having spoken to the doctor regarding my wife's health he informed me that he had not completed my wifes treatment and he had not instructed the community nurse to interfer in my wife's case. The following day I was asked to go into an office where I was informed that my wife was to be transfered to a Transition Care Home, there were five people in the room . I felt that all of these allied health people were attempting to tell me what was best for my wife until I informed them that I had spoken to my wife's doctor the previous evening and told my wife was too ill to leave hospital and that the doctor had in fact not completed the treatment. I think the people in question were not acting on medical advice but refused to inform me of their decision that my wife was fit to leave hospital when it was obvious to me (with no medical experience) that she was not. I have since learned that had I permitted my wife's transfer to a home that the cost would have apparently been the responsibility of the Federal Government. I feel that my wife's physical and mental health was being put at risk by the Qld Health Dept to apparently save money. I must add that the treatment my wife was given in Caboolture Hospital and also her care at our home was excellent.

Author: the patient
Story: I was admitted to Noosa Hospital recently for surgery and was most unimpressed with the nursing care I received. It began when a pair of white stockings were tossed on my pre surgery bed and I was instructed to put them on. Never having done this before, by 8pm they were like a tourniquet, and fortunately when I asked for them to be removed, a nurse refitted them. After surgery, I remained in my surgical gown until the next morning - no offer was made to change me into night attire. I was told that I would be given a post-op wash however no-one ever came to do this. I was offered pain relief and it was an hour before a Panediene Forte was brought. I asked for something to eat and was told no, however after a visit from the Registrar, and my request for some sandwiches, they were brought. During the night I was given two lots of antibiotics through the Canula together with a water wash. During the third treatment the nurse only injected the antibiotic and when I asked about the water wash I was told by the nurse that he had forgotten about that. During the night, when one male patient in a nearby room pressed the buzzer for help, I heard a nurse call out to that patient in a very loud voice from the corridor asking what he wanted. I then heard the nurse say to another colleague that that patient doesn't know what he wants. I thought the staff were excellent at taking blood pressure ALL night even though mine had been perfect from early afternoon. I can understand that this is required however.. I also thought the surgery nurses, including the anaesthetistâ€™s assistant and the nurses in Recovery were excellent but the care I received from the remainder of the nursing staff, in my opinion was appalling.

Story: I have recently posted a comprehensive story about my disabled daughter and her near demise as a result of her being admitted to an adult medical ward, even though she only weighed 20kg. I believe this was a result of QLD Health policy, which in my understanding states that utilising a paediatric service is determined solely by a patients age, with their weight not being a consideration. I would be remiss if I did not give huge kudos to the director of ICU at Mackay Base Hospital - Mahesh - who I thought went way beyond the call of duty to keep my daughter alive and to fight against all obstacles to find her a place in a Brisbane ICU. An amazing effort and one we will be forever grateful for. To me it seemed that everyone else had decided she was going to die. The nursing staff in the ICU were also angels! My daughter is now doing well.

Story: My daughter was mauled by a dog and had severe lacerations, gauges and deep wounds to her face, neck and upper body. In my state of horror, I did not call for an ambulance but decided to take her to the Ipswich Hospital. My experience with the all staff in the Emergency dept. from the ward clerk, triage nurses and doctors was absolutely fabulous. As soon as they realised that my little girl would need extra attention than they could give they organised to have her transferred to Mater Childrenâ€™s Hospital. They acted quickly, efficiently and professionally and I thought they were unreal in their care and concern for my daughter. I simply cannot thank the staff at Ipswich Emergency enough. Sadly the treatment I received by the security guard when I first arrived and parked my car in the emergency bay at the hospital was what I can describe as only barbaric. Whist holding my bloody, hysterical and distraught child, the security guard walked over to me and in a what I thought was a threatening manner told me that if I didnâ€™t move my car in 2 minutes he was going to call the police. He did not render any assistance whatsoever. I parked in the emergency bay as this was clearly an emergency and did not appreciate being spoken to like that when surely it was obvious what I was doing and that I had an emergency. I donâ€™t know if he has the authority to treat people like that and maybe the reason for having emergency parking bays needs to be clearly explained, either the public is unaware of why they are there or the security guards are unaware as to what actually an emergency is and their â€˜roleâ€™. This whole situation could have turned very nasty as he made me very agitated and I was ready to punch him. I am still absolutely disgusted at the treatment we received by this guard and can only say that this can be a very negative influence on the hospital.

The new oncology section being built at Ipswich Hospital has cubicles, and it appears it will not allow patients to see each other, also, in my opinion making it difficult for nurses to supervise. At the very least I would like to see the cubicle partitions removed and replaced by curtains which can be used for privacy when necessary. I think now would be the time to make the alterations as it is currently under construction.

On arrival at emergency I explained at the front desk my problem and within minutes I was being cared for by doctors and nurses. After having being stabilised and receiving pain relief I was soon on my way to the Prince Charles Hospital in an ambulance. On arriving at Prince Charles Hospital I was once again very well looked after by the doctors and nurses. I was released from Prince Charles five days later. At all times at both hospitals the care and attention I received was fantastic and I have nothing but praise for all the doctors and nurses who looked after me. I would also like to heap praise on the two paramedics who took care of me on my trip between hospitals. I hold the doctors, nurses, and paramedics I have dealt with in high regard, and with many thanks for their help.

Story: My husband was a very fit, active 67 year old. Suffered from gout occasionallly, had started to have minor high blood pressure. On 6th. December complained at 11. 00am about a sore shoulder and thought he had strained a muscle. By 3. 00pm he had gone down on the bowls green with severe pain and clammy. Ambulance was called, arrived promptly, he was stabilised and transported to Caboolture Hospital, feeling okay and was sure that it was a strained muscle. At 6pm another spasm of pain worse than first. Waited until 11. 00pm for blood test results, explained to us that he had a mild heart attack, no1 on scale, so decided to keep him in hospital. Still in the emergency department. At 8 am, he had breakfast, we explained that we had private health insurance so getting a bed anywhere was priority. He had lunch, still no bed available anywhere. By 3pm, he was in distress again only more severe, He was transported urgently to Prince Charles Hospital by ambulance with Doctor. At around 5pm. an angiogram was performed. We were allowed to see him and they informed us that they had inserted a drain to drain off fluid from around his heart, he would be a "different" man in the morning, and a specialist would look at him. They assured us that he would only sleep now, he seemed to be comfortable. We left about 8pm. By 3. 45am he was pronounced dead. We rushed to the hospital but were too late. They informed us that he had 40% of his blood outside his heart. I am at a loss to understand why he died in such a hospital, we thought that as he was in Prince Charles everything would be fine, they could do anything with hearts. I have not received the autopsy report as yet, and I do want it to be exact, but there are many questions we have. A fit man with no previous heart problems, dies? Their statement was " we could not believe what was happening in front of us, the machine was not saying what was happening". Was the machine faulty? Were the Doctors faulty? We want to know why he passed away.

But in Broken Hill I have not found it easy to find a doctor who will listen to me. What do I do?

Story: I was refered to the genetics clinic at KEMH in Perth as I have a genetic condition and was considering having children. The genetic councellor was lovely and seemed well informed and very happy to help. The consultant was not, I thought his demeanor was rude, he appeared bored and I felt he talked down to me. I thought the appointment would at the very least increase my knowledge about my condition it did not, in fact I felt I had more knowledge of the genetics of my condition than the consultant. I feel sorry for all the other patients that will have to deal with this man.

Title: My tubes were tied against my wishes and without consent

Author: the patient
Story: I had a planned caesarean in 2011 and had earlier decided not to have my tubes tied and withdrew consent. The doctor who performed my surgery made me feel so small and insignificant and, in my opinion went so far as to insult me because I had changed my mind. I found out not quite a year later that my tubes were tied. As to how they were tied or clamped or cut, no one seems to know. The only reason I found out was because of the excruciating pain I was in when I ovulated. I now suffer insomnia, irregular incredibly heavy periods, ovary pain, acne, intense itching, constipation, mood swings and cannot have any more children. I was 28 when this happened. I tried to complain, I felt it was all ignored, I asked whether or not my tubes had been tied, that was denied. I'm scarred for life because of 1 doctor. 1 doctor who I believe had absolutely no right to do what they did.

Time: 2013-04-22T00:16:09Z

Author: the patient
Story: After I slipped and fell on a wet floor in my home I was taken by Queensland Ambulance to RBWH DEM (emergency department). I was seen by training doctor, resident doctor and senior doctor as well as a physiotherapist and the consensus was that I had muscle and ligament straight. No x-ray was done. I was provided with a support bandage which the physio placed on my very swollen very painful knee, given panadine forte and told to consult a private physiotherapist in a week or so. I sought advice about the danger of DVT as I have a history of this and was reassured this was not likely. I was not given crutches and after hobbling out the door the physiotherapist came up behind me with a cane that she had tracked down. I declined the offer as by this time I was in a great deal of pain and just wanted to get home. I did so by cab. Four days later I consulted a local private physiotherapist who lent me crutches for which I was very thankful as I had been using a broom to get around the house up to that point. I made a follow up appointment for later that week and saw a physiotherapist again who suspected fracture and insisted I have a MRI. The MRI revealed a medium ligament tear and two fractures around the knee. I had an x-ray which confirmed this. This occurred over a week after the injury occurred. The private physiotherapist provided me with a brace which I was advised by her to wear at all times until I could see a specialist. She contacted a knee specialist for me and arranged to get me an appointment as soon as possible. My GP referred me to an orthopaedic surgeon who recommended I commence a course of clexane to minimize risk of DVT. I was treated quickly at the hospital and those treating me were pleasant however, I believe an x-ray undertaken on the day of injury would have saved me much angst. In my opinion not one person at the hospital was at fault, I believe it was a process failure. To me it appeared that there was too much pressure to get what appears to be a person with minor injury out of the door in record time possibly so that it reflected well in KPMs. Yes this occurred, to my detriment but I bet the numbers looked good.

He said he arrived at 0700hrs and was the first person there. At 1030hrs he said he was still waiting for his angiogram. He stated he noticed that all other patients who had arrived after him were seen before him. He felt he was being discriminated against because he was black. He told me no-one approached him to explain that there is a 'list' and where he was on the list. In my opinion this demonstrated a complete lack of cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity around Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons perception of hospitals.

Story: I recently considered taking a family member to the Ipswich Emergency Department but found it to be congested and in my opinion dangerous. The walkway to Emergency Department meant that we had to walk through parked Ambulances, then to make matters worse when we made our way into the triage area we witnessed what I thought was poor attitude of the Triage staff at Ipswich Emergency Department. I felt they spoke in a very rude tone to some patients that were waiting to be seen. I heard a gentlemen that was speaking with the Nurse at the desk, and a woman berate a person for coming to the Emergency department when they appeared to have an infection and need a dressing changed. In my opinion even though this didnâ€™t appear to be a life threatening injury there may not have been an alternate treatment or options for this elderly gentleman. I would never choose to go to an Emergency Department unless I needed their care. I believe some people who are less fortunate don't have the luxury of good health and supportive people close by. These are the people that are supposed to care for those of us. It doesn't cost a cent to be kind to another human being.

A small but interested group heard what I thought was a very complete and very useful address that covered a range of topics about dementia including signs, prevention strategies, the varieties of dementia, the cause and treatments currently accepted, the effects of dementia in the various sections of the brain and management strategies. I thought it was an outstanding event which will begin the Coleambally Community's education of this growing issue. Merylise and Ros are wonderful people that seem willing to travel and share. Both visit Coleambally frequently and I hope the community will become more aware of what they are doing because of this event. Wonderful health care individuals. Lucky us.

The staff accompanied me through to the Sub Acute Care area after only a short wait time in the temporary wait area and the care and attention I received in the SAC is to be commended. Of particular note, was the ED Dr - Thomas who was the treating Dr, I would like to thank him for his attention to detail and rapid diagnosis and effective treatment.

We were expecting to have to wait at least a few hours as we had also been to Wyoming Medical Centre first - where they had a 3 hour wait to see a doctor - which I thought was appalling. We were taken straight into triage as soon as we arrived at Gosford Hospital, and within 5 minutes of being assessed in triage she had been put into a bed with IV drips in place and a myriad of nurses and doctors taking blood tests and looking after her. I thought the service and care she received from all staff, both in the emergency ward and in the ward afterwards was exceptional. I can't praise them enough for their care and professionalism, and am happy to say that my daughter-in-law is back home with her lovely family.

Title: Fitting of cardiac stents (The Sunshine Coast Private Hospital)
Time: 2013-05-12T09:11:27Z
Location: The Sunshine Coast Private Hospital / Cardiology;
Author: the patient
Story: In 2010 I booked in with referral from my GP for a stress test at the Sunshine Coast Buderim Private hospital. In my opinion I was fit, healthy in my 60â€™s with very good health, no heart attack nor stroke, good blood pressure, never breathless or overweight. I have always been extremely active, never smoked nor eaten fast foods, and 2 glasses of wine per week. The stress test was not performed and the doctor I saw said he wanted to perform an angiogram, with stenting; if any blockages were found. He never mentioned angina to me. The reason for this visit was I had damaged a chest muscle, with severe pain that lasted for over 2 hours and with the only relief being from placing my chest on to a pillow on the bed whilst kneeling beside. The incidence of chest pain was very intense 7. 5 out of 10. The next morning when I lifted a heavy object in the garden I felt a slight twinge in same area 1 out of 10 intensity. I had been riding my mountain bike for exercise [ 35km, average 24. 5, 3 times a week ] when the pain first appeared, so as I had a 2 week wait before seeing the doctor for the stress test, I thought I would carefully monitor myself. I started brisk walking the following morning and in the first 100mt I felt a slight niggle in pectoral 1 out of 10 intensity. I then commenced riding at brisk pace and always had very slight niggle at warm up that completely disappeared in very short distance, with no further pain I believe I had Stents inappropriately fitted as I did not think I had angina and no tests were performed. The doctor did not seem to listen when I informed him of severe pains and no energy on 40mg of Lipitor, he then prescribed 40mg of Crestor, which to my knowledge is closer to 3 times stronger than Lipitor. Total cholesterol at commencement of Statins reduced with 40mg of Lipitor. I now have permanent muscle damage which precludes me from sleeping as I see every hour on the hour even after ceasing Crestor in late 2010. I believe this doctor has ruined my quality of life. I would not recommend the Sunshine Coast Buderim Private Hospital to any patient. I believe the hospital management were complicit in covering for the cardiologist, whom I believe performed a fraudulent procedure [stenting without symptoms], falsified his files of consultations, which I have in my possession, and was incompetent by prescribing Crestor 4 times higher than dosage sheet. My legacy of this, is I see every hour on the hour with debilitating muscle leg pains, which precludes me from sleeping.

Author: a relative
Story: My father is an amputee living in Algester Lodge as a high-care resident funded by the Government. October last year we investigated a motorised scooter for him. The resident physio was in attendance but denied all knowledge of being at the preliminary meeting where my father was assessed as competent. After discussions with the facility it was agreed that I would rent the scooter until my father was assessed. He was assessed by the resident physio and found to be not competent. I was denied access to this assessment based on the fact that the document was an internal document. I then engaged QADA to assist and with their help the facility and I agreed to a set of terms and conditions. One of these conditions was to have a qualified assessment done by a reputable physio - DART (Mater Hospital) did this assessment to which I had to pay. This was conducted and my father was found very component to drive the motorised scooter. I certainly question the original assessment. Slight changes were made by the facility to the terms and conditions without any negotiations however I let them go in order to give my father some independence. My father's doctor (Dr.K) requested an eye test and then gave consent for my father to use the scooter. My father then saw a doctor (PA Hospital) to be assessed for an artificial leg. This doctor noted in his letter that my father could not use his motorised scooter. Based on this information the facility and Dr K refused my father access to his scooter - a scooter he has been waiting to use since October last year. Neither the facility nor Dr.K have provided me with adequate or satisfactory explanations to why they did this except that it was based on the PA doctorâ€™s letter. After discussions with this PA doctor I was told by him that he was not aware of the full information nor of DART's assessment and that he "didnâ€™t know all the facts". I was told by the facility that Dr. K was to have a discussion with this PA doctor. Despite attempts to have this rectified my father continues to be denied his independence after 7 months of living with hope for some quality of life. I have lodged a complaint with the Aged Care Tribunal as well as the Health Quality Commissioner and hope to have this rectified before my father leaves this earth - 7 months is a long time when you are 84 years of age.

Location: Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital / Cardiology;
Author: the patient
Story: It is my belief that a senior Royal Brisbane Hospital electrocardiologist failed for three (3) years to adequately supervise his junior team to detect a tumour; which was apparently clearly identifiable in my blood work. After removal of the tumour I attended my appointment (booked for three or four days after tumour surgery). At the appointment I said I wished to speak with the electrocardiologist to get an explanation of why and how the tumour went undetected for such a period of time. I heard the nurse tell the consultant and heard what sounded to me like his very disgruntled complaining and saying 'no'. He refused to explain to me why the incompetence of his 'team' and sent a registra out to see me in the waiting room. This junior doctor told me that he could answer my questions; but I pointed out that he was the last person to assure me I did not have a tumour and he too had supposedly read the blood work. I stayed in that waiting room for several hours; until close. I was sent a variety of administration staff and nursing staff to tell me I needed to see the registra even after I clearly explained I wanted the consultant to tell me why his team had apparently failed. I was in pain and supposed to be in bed as I was still recovering from the removal of the tumour. Finally a clerk turned up in the waiting room with a form and told me that if I wanted to see the consultant I could do so privately in the private clinic. I was not seen by any doctor; and just left in the waiting room. Later I tried contact with the patient advocating but found this even more patronising. I would very much like this hospital to be answerable for this; I am sure there is an independent body that can investigate. Sorry is not good enough. The consultant seemed furious; and glared at me every time he came out.

They appeared to disregard any medical evidence gleaned from medical facilities around the world, and instead seemed to rely on the Medical Health Board cardiologist, who practices together in the same Sunshine Coast Buderim Private Hospital, and is a colleague of this incompetent cardiologist I have lodged the complaint about. In my opinion this is bias at its highest, in these incompetent Health and Government bodies. Section F of their response States: â€˜the dosage of crestor is applicable to the Australian Heart Foundation guidelinesâ€™ > I believe this is a total lie, as when I contacted the Heart Foundation they emphatically stated that it is up to the clinician to monitor and prescribe dosage. I have been informed from another independent body that they know of this incompetent cardiologist in NSW, and that he is on their black list. They also stated that he is known to Queensland Health and believe he should be deregistered.

Story: Kate has organised a number of health care sessions for the Men's Shed. Topics have centred around men's health eg prostate problems, cardiac issues. Recently Kate organised a very successful Men's Pitstop where a number of health professionals provided information. One of the men was advised to see his GP about a darkness on his neck. He has subsequently had surgery to remove it. It was good to have members of the shed openly discussing health issues and problems and swapping war stories. More sessions as required and another pitstop in 12 months would be good. The members were all positive in their comments.

They dove into the to hard basket, read my records, about my Chrones diseases and have made a difference in my life, concerning my pain management, and my vomiting attacks with sever abdominal pain. A big thanks to them. I would like to give a big blast to the nurse, who dared say in front of people who know me well, that they hated working at the Ipswich because they 'baby' junkies, as this comment was directed towards me, the staff who knew me really put her in her place. I believe her ignorance found its bounds that day. Thank you Ward 7c and the staff members who stood to my defence.

Now that I have to care for my husband, I need to get myself fitter and lose weight so that I am able to look after him. I have found the program very beneficial and helpful. It is good to be able to do this in a group and be able to discuss problems with others who have similar problems.

Story: I recently experienced chest pains and sweating so I spoke to 13 health who then contacted the ambulance for me to talk to, they advised they would send paramedics who arrived in a very short time, after checks I was advised to allow transport to Ipswich Hospital. On arrival at the hospital I was "ramped" not as seen on tv but I was inside the hospital with both paramedics in constant contact, wasn't an unpleasant experience. After a while I was moved into emergency where I was checked and tested by a number of staff in a considerate and careful manner, when a bed was available I was moved to the short stay ward around midnight. I spent 2 nights in this ward with what I would say by professional and considerate staff. I was then moved to ward 7B, a very busy full ward where I spent the night and had more examinations and a stress test around mid day, I was discharged around 4-30. During my whole experience I was impressed with the services offered, the courtesy and assistance provided by all staff from the start to the finish. I did not find fault with any service, perhaps more staff may improve the service as it seemed to me they were all over worked though they stayed positive. I sincerely hope these comments will be passed to all departments I was involved with including the ambulance service with my very grateful thanks.

It is for this reason that I have asked RSL Care if they could stop sending a cleaner to my place at 7: 30 am as it is very difficult for me to get up and get ready at that time, especially if I have had to get up during the night to take my medication. The person I spoke to about this assured me that they would not be sending anyone over to my house at that time (7: 30am) but instead would send someone over around lunch time. However, at the next visit the cleaner arrived at 7: 20am and when I was unable to answer the door she called me on the phone (while she was at my door) and seemed very annoyed with me and complained to me. The cleaner didnâ€™t seem to know anything about the new arrangement or that I had spoken to someone about having a cleaner arrive at a later time.

Story: The cleaning service that was provided to us recently was very good. The lady was very nice and did an absolutely wonderful job, however we have not been very pleased with the recent communication we have had with RSL Care regarding rescheduling of a service. I called to notify them that our power was going to be turned off and not to send someone over at that time as we didn't want anyone to waste their time and petrol. I was asked if we would like to schedule another service for the following day, which we did, and then I was told that they would call us back confirming the time the service would be provided. We never received a call. My husband and I waited all day in case someone turned up but no one did. After waiting all day I called RSL Care and asked what had happened. They repeated the message they had taken from my previous phone call and it was totally incorrect. Also I received a letter in the mail today from RSL Care stating that we had previously been informed that there will be a client contribution commencing in July for these services. However, we have received no such information regarding a client contribution.

Title: Geelong Hospital emergency department
Time: 2013-06-28T13:23:03Z
Location: Geelong Hospital / Accident & emergency;
Author: a relative
Story: Last week, at 3 am, my husband presented at Geelong Hospital emergency department with an acute pain in his neck and left shoulder. Eventually he was seen briefly by a doctor, and offered painkillers. Over the period of 6 and a half hours, he was given several different drugs, including Endone and Voltarin. When I came in at 8am, and dared to interrupt the nursing staff, who I overheard discussing their weekend plans to receive an update, I was rudely told he had been given medication to help the pain. No response when I said it was not helping, or asked what else was being done. When the doctor returned briefly for the second time at around 8:30 am, my husband explained to her that the pain was worse than it had been when he arrived. The doctor said she would send a physio. She appeared to make no attempt to discuss his pain, other symptoms etc. He was then seen briefly by a physio, who advised it might be a bulging disc, and that he would need to go to his GP and also a non-hospital physio, and also get a better chair for work. He was then discharged. I am absolutely appalled that not one attempt was made to investigate the cause of the problem, even though he was in severe pain and advising that the pain was getting worse, despite the drugs given. No x-ray, no MRI, no diagnostic test of any sort. After a full week, his pain is just as severe, and he is averaging 2 or 3 hours sleep a night due to this. He has arranged - of his own accord - to see a physio, who now will not treat him until he has an MRI. The physio was appalled that the hospital did not even attempt to investigate the problem. We were also told we would have a physio referral, but instead received a letter saying Barwon Health had handballed that to another local health service, and we have heard nothing more. He has been back to the GP twice, who was also in disbelief that no tests were conducted in the ED. We are now out of pocket more than $300 dollars, thanks to GP visits, physio and medication. (not to mention the $400 chair we purchased on the hospital physio's advice). A week later he is still in excruciating pain. We have a referral for the MRI, (an outpatient mri at Geelong Hospital), and have been told this will cost us $250. I am so disgusted at the treatment (or lack thereof) that he received in Geelong Hospital ED. In my opinion, the only treatment he received was to pump him full of as many drugs as possible, to try and mask the pain so that they could discharge him without actually bothering to investigate the cause. When he advised that the pain was worse after 6 and a half hours and numerous different drugs, he was simply sent home to put up with it. I cannot understand why were no diagnostic tests done? What if there is a more serious issue with his neck? What liability would the ED have for the lack of care provided? We are also now expected to pay a fortune for an MRI at the hospital, that should have been referred from the ED, and there is a delay to book in for this MRI - all the while he is suffering. I could go on about the time I walked in with a 5 month old infant last year, who had croup and was struggling to breathe, to be rudely told off by the reception staff to wait my turn in the queue. Even the 6 or so people ahead of me were telling me to take their places. Thank god that a local GP clinic with an emergency service was open and I was able to walk out and take him there. Or the time last September my 2 and a half year old with a heart defect, was brought in via ambulance with croup, only to be dosed with pred and shoved out into the waiting room. Even the ambos were flabbergasted at his treatment. It took until he went downhill to be admitted finally and given further medication. I felt that the staff were so inconsiderate, they used adult size ECG stickers which were painful to get off a child's delicate skin, as they apparently couldn't be bothered to go and find the kids' ones. The list goes on, it seems everyone I know has a horror story about the treatment in Geelong Hospital ED! In the meantime, I have spoken to the doctor who treated my husband, and she has advised that he didn't present with 'neurological' based symptoms to warrant an MRI or any other kind of investigative test. This despite the fact he has tingling and loss of movement, plus a previous history of a neurological issue in his shoulder / neck region. She denied being aware of this - despite the fact I was in the room when my husband discussed this with her. Further to that, the physio he saw in the ED stated it was likely a pinched nerve, and he needed to get a prescription for a nerve drug - pregablin. Yet still the doctor denies it was neurological and stated therefore it did not warrant any diagnostic investigation. So 9 days later he is still in agony, physio refuse to touch him without an MRI, and we are still waiting - and out of pocket $250 - for the MRI. I think this is absolutely disgraceful. What an appalling lack of care!!

Author: the patient
Story: I was having a small skin cancer cut off the side of my face through the public system at the Mater in Brisbane. The team was in the middle of a conversation about other things when I was lead into the operating theatre. They seemed to make no effort to engage with me or run through what they were about to do to my body. After 10 minutes of waiting for them to finish and wondering if I should say something I asked them as politely as my jitters and anger would allow, to please stop talking about other things and people and be present with my procedure and the present moment. They complied and the surgeon said "Oh we are just putting the local in" like that was supposed to explain everything. After that they were better at making sure I was informed about what was happening but half way through the surgery while cutting and using a laser on me both the nurse and the surgeon once again started talking about other patients and scheduling issues again. I was so angry and upset but I didn't want to say anything as I thought an angry team would be more dangerous than a distracted one. The surgery was just a local anaesthetic procedure and to them might have seemed minor but from my perspective I felt like they were as present and focused as someone texting while driving. I am not going to submit a formal complaint as the surgery was free and they appeared busy and were maybe just trying to fit as much into the day as they could but I think it is very dangerous behaviour and I hope that telling my story here may help prevent this sort of thing happening again.

Story: While I acknowledge that the switch over of the program to RSL is a huge project and likely to cause many complications, I was rather taken aback by the lady handling the Rostering segment (phone no. 5490 6360) before I'd hardly opened my mouth to explain my situation she told me that she was tired of all the people demanding morning services. I spoke passively and said that I certainly wasn't demanding, I just wished to explain my own circumstances. The lady seemed in no mood to even listen and kept reiterating that we had to take what we could get and no chance of an advance warning of when that might be. So I thanked her and requested that she cross my name off the list, and I would just have to manage on my own. Following which, she made an offer that I could have Thursdays with a guarantee that my person would be finished by 11. 30am - but not this week. Another 2 weeks hence. I can accept that but still wonder why the lady was so rude in the first place. Query number 2? Why the big secret about the "Client Contribution" which begins in July. It is already July and no one I have spoken to has any idea just how much the contribution will be? ? ?

Author: a parent/guardian
Story: I would like to share both a good and a bad experience I had recently when my daughter visited 2 local Emergency rooms. It started in Boonah, at the general hospital. I took my daughter to the ER after complaining at school of her hip being hurt and making a popping sound. When we arrived in Boonah the staff were more than helpful. Tracey the Nurse who assisted us was exceptional when dealing with my daughter. There were another 5 patients who came in and at no one time did her bed side manner change. She explained her concerns and said we were best to go to Ipswich in the ambulance and get an x-ray or scan of her hip as they didn't have the facilities. The doctor was called and he too said that there was a difference in her hips that was concerning. We were transferred to Ipswich in the ambulance (I followed behind as I was told that they would not transfer us back). When we arrived my daughter was on the bed and the ambulance officer and a doctor in the ER were talking. They got her to get up and walk around. At this stage the two men said that there was nothing wrong with her. I explained that I was disappointed as I had just travelled from Boonah. If the ambulance officer said this back then I wouldnâ€™t have come down. My daughter then said that she was given a green whistle in the ambulance as the bumps made it very painful. I asked the officer again if he thought there was anything wrong and he said no I donâ€™t believe so. I then continued to ask why they give her pain relief in the ambulance. He didnâ€™t answer me and walked away. The two ladies in the ER said I would need to leave the room now with my daughter as she had been seen and nothing more can be done. I said that I would sit in the waiting room and that I wanted a second opinion as the two hospitals were saying different things and I didn't understand why they would send me down for a scan to be turned away. About 30 minutes later another doctor arrived and seemed to look at my daughterâ€™s hip more closely and said yes there was definitely a difference in size and movement and because she was still in pain he would get a scan done. We were then moved to the minor acute section where we were seen by two lovely staff, one nurse who seemed to be in charge and a doctor I believe. They were wonderful and even speed up the process as we were to wait around 4 hours for a scan. I thought the wards person (a lady) that came to take her to the scan was extremely rude to us. At first she said I wasn't allowed to follow my daughter until the nurse said yes I need to go in as she is a minor, then it seemed she wheeled my daughter so fast that she nearly hit the wall and two police officers that were walking through the hall. I had to walk so fast to catch her that I was just about running. She continued to call my daughter by the wrong name. My daughter had her scan and the lady completing this was very helpful and explained a lot to us even showing my daughter where the damage was. She explained that the doctor would explain more but she will be in pain for a few weeks. The ward person was there waiting when we got out and I refused to be taken with her again so the lady who did the scan took us back. I saw the ward person lady pull a face in front of me and heard her say that she had better things to do anyway. My concern was that an ambulance officer gave my daughter pain relief when he said she didn't need it and the fact that she was underage and I hadn't given permission. Also I thought most of the ER staff in Ipswich were very unhelpful and rude to me and my daughter and diagnosed her without consultation and that we could have been turned away if I hadn't asked for a second opinion. My daughter had damaged her muscles around her hip maybe from a dislocation. I would like to thank Tracey at Boonah and the two staff members at Ipswich Hospital - the head nurse and the scan lady for all their help and understanding.

The GP was fabulous, the staff at Q Scan gave her priority for the x ray and were very supportive on her diagnosis. The staff at Brisbane Northside Emergency were just wonderful and very competent. It is very stressful as a parent to see your child unwell and I was kept informed and included at all times. The Specialists and all the staff that we saw at the Holy Spirit Northside were very caring and professional, I felt very comfortable leaving my daughter particularly at night in their care. The admission was 5 days including surgery and went seamlessly. My daughter is now home and doing well, Thank you to all the staff, there were many involved in her care.

Location: Wagga Wagga Base Hospital;
Author: a relative
Story: My father was a patient at Wagga Base Hospital back in May, and I too was horrified at the state of the hospital. My father is elderly with a heart and lung condition, and although has high private medical cover, he chooses to use his private cover to help with the public system â€“ however I do not think he will make this choice anymore. He was admitted through Emergency, and although, in my opinion, the emergency department was certainly looking tired and dated, the staff were wonderful, and attentive in the emergency department. We have nothing but praise for their service. However, when Dad finally got a bed, he was admitted to Ward 3, it was a different story. What a disgrace, it looked run down, untidy and according to my father the bathroom (only one in operation- for the entire floor) was filthy, with urine over the floor. I agree with â€œrainbowsâ€? comments https://www.patientopinion.org.au/opinions/58400 about the food. Besides the quality, the hot piping soup hermetically sealed with plastic, in my opinion is an accident waiting to happen. The food is â€œplonkedâ€? down, sometimes missing the appropriate cutlery, we buttered a roll with a spoon, or ate ice cream with its lid, and if my family at the time visiting hadnâ€™t attended the very frail gentleman in the bed next to my father, he may not have eaten, as often we observed he could not open his food (ie: soup etc). The first day, I asked the dinner lady, if my father could have some water in his jug, she pointed to the sink in the hall where the nurses/doctors washed their hands and told me to fill it up myself. One day it appeared that only one lift for the whole hospital was working, so that after lengthy delays and being kicked out three times of the lift to make way for patients/food trays etc, by the time we had reached Level 1, we instead took to the steps making my 75 year old mother climb three levels of stairs. Nurses were going searching from room to room to find what seemed like the only working â€œvitalsâ€? machine for all the patients, and I only had to walk down the corridor, and see all the broken machines and equipment lining the corridor with signs to see how much upgrading/fixing of resources/equipment is needed. My father had an incident with his heart early the first morning (he was wearing a monitor), and nurses upon attending him, advised him that if he felt a little funny, or anything out of the ordinary he was to press his buzzer. However, his buzzer was faulty and did not always work, they just remarked keep buzzing, it will at some stage buzz! His bedside phone did not work, in fact I am not really sure what really was working. There was many more minor incidents I could re-tell, and perhaps if they only were isolated, I could laugh it off, but when it was one after another, then it became just beyond a joke. Perhaps the biggest and most worrying aspect of Dadâ€™s visit, was after that first morning (when Dad had an incident with his heart), my mother had asked if we could speak to a doctor about what had occurred, this was at 9 am. The nurse told us that a doctor would pop in and see us. Late that afternoon we still had not heard, I asked a nurse again if the doctor would be coming in to see us, as we were worried about my father, and would like to know what is happening, she assured us that she would see what was happening. She came back and said that unfortunately the doctor had been called away, and did not get to see us, and someone had forgotten to tell us. She briefly informed us that it was a small incident with his heart, and dad having a history of heart trouble, we requested that we would like Dad to be seen by a heart specialist, and we were told that a certain heart specialist (we were given a name) would see him. By 7pm that night, still no sign of a doctor, and I decided I would take my mother home as she was drooping (she had not as yet had lunch or dinner â€“ refusing to leave my father in case the doctor came). As we were leaving a man was entering the ward, and looked indeed like a specialist, so I ran back to the nurses station to advise them that I was taking my mother home, but could they tell me if he was the heart specialist (I gave the doctors name) that we were advised earlier that would see my father. They looked at me strangely and said, that it would be a bit hard for that doctor to see my father, as that doctor left on annual leave the day before. I was now so frustrated and upset, no-one seemed to know what was happening. A young intern behind me, overhearing my comments, said that she would help and look at my fathers records, to give us some idea of what happened, I could not speak highly enough of this intern. She also said that she would see if her specialist that she was interning under, could add Dad to his list, and see him tomorrow. Unfortunately that didnâ€™t happen. Nor did our request of Dad seeing a heart specialist, whilst dad was in hospital instead it was left for him to see one when he was discharged. I do not know the reason why the hospital appears so run down, but something needs to be done, there is lots of money being put into building the new hospital â€“ but is this to expense of todayâ€™s patients? ? ?

Story: The ambulance was called when I fell and hit my head. From the moment they arrived from the Birkdale station I felt in good hands. They were calm and caring. They talked me through everything and explained and asked questions and permission as if I was part of the solution to the situation. I felt fully informed and cared for. When we arrived at the hospital they handed me over - with a comprehensive explanation and then just left - no fuss. I was introduced to the ED doctor immediately and assessed - he consulted a superior at one stage. I was sent for scan. My haematoma was cleared and stitches put in. I was sent home.

Story: I am so happy and grateful to have someone to clean the house since I had my knee replacement. My helper is such a lovely person, seems happy to have a chat with me, and a good worker. I think she is unhappy because I rang last week to cancel this week's clean as I'd thought I'd still be in hospital, but was discharged earlier than expected. I was happy that she came, but had I still been in hospital, she would have arrived here at her usual time and I would not have been here. Apparently this is the second time it has happened to her, so it appears there is obviously a lack of communication at Burnie Brae, asking her to drive to homes where there has been a cancellation but no-one seems to have informed her. This may be happening to other cleaners, so there is a problem which I think has to be fixed. Hoping all will be well soon. Thank you for providing me with this cleaning service.

Story: We had a nice lady come a couple of weeks ago to give us forms to fill out which we did. We informed her that since RSL Care has taken over we noticed mould had started to grow in our bathroom, I think because the new people being sent had not been cleaning it properly. We showed her the mould and were told she would let RSL Care know. Before RSL Care has taken over there was not one smidgeon of mould in our shower and the standard of cleaning was high. We had a lovely range of people who came to clean our house. However, it seems to me that unlike previous people who had come to clean our house (experienced cleaners), the people being sent by RSL Care donâ€™t appear to have any cleaning experience or know what it takes to really clean a house. I donâ€™t understand why they couldn't employ the same people who previously cleaned our house? I believe that whoever employed these folk may not have a clear understanding of what house cleaning is or the requirements they need to have to do the job well. I would also like to leave a compliment for Amber who recently cleaned our house. I showed Amber the mould in the bathroom hoping she would be able to remove it. When Amber was finished cleaning the bathroom she called me in to have a look â€“ she did an absolutely wiz bang job and all the mould was gone! I admired the fact that she was so proud of the work she had done. Another issue I have encountered is with the Home Assist Service (Handyman service inside pensionerâ€™s homes). We have a leaking tap that needs to be fixed and we are unable to fix it ourselves. The number on the brochure we were given (when the government was providing the HACC service) is 3284 0526. There is a voice recording which asks to leave a contact number, I have called several times and left a message but have not yet heard back from them. Is this service still available?

Title: An awful ordeal for my teenage old son at Canberra Hospital
Time: 2013-08-07T11:35:48Z
Location: Canberra Hospital / Accident & emergency;
Author: a parent/guardian
Story: Recently I took my son to the emergency dept at The Canberra Hospital and he was seen promptly and was diagnosed with appendicitis, he was in a lot of pain and given strong pain killers, we were told he needed surgery and later he was transferred to a holding ward. 13 hours later we were informed that he had been "bumped" and not having his operation as there was no theatre and staff available due to other priorities, I was very angry and upset for my son. The next morning I expected he would be first as he had been delayed already but we were told they hoped to do it today but no promises due to other priorities. I was taught appendicitis was an emergency! 4pm that day he was moved to Day surgery and eventually at 8: 30pm he went for his operation. On removal of the appendix it perforated so now he would need 2-7 days of IV antibiotics. He remained in day surgery. Two days after his operation he was in lots of pain, an extended abdomen and now a temperature of 39. I asked for an ultrasound as I suspected pus in his abdominal cavity, I was ignored but eventually they agreed to do the next morning. It showed fluid and pus so my poor son had to go back to theatre for a second operation to clear out the fluid and pus and had a drain put in for 2 days. He was moved to a ward after the second operation to find he had to share with a female patient which I feel was totally unacceptable. I feel very strongly about the fact that if the operation had not been delayed he would not have had complications. In the long run it has cost the hospital more money and by not opening another theatre, my son had 2 operations and 9 days in hospital. The statistics do not appear to look at emergency waiting times.

Author: the patient
Story: I presented at Ballan District Health and Hospital Community centre with chest pain and even though the service was very busy (all the waiting rooms were full and overflowing) the staff at reception prioritised me, called straight through to a nurse who presumably stopped what she was doing and took me immediately through to a room and asked me questions about my chest pain. She informed me she wanted to discuss with this a doctor and then popped out to have a chat with a GP who, despite appearing busy stopped in to see me between his patients and advised the nurse to conduct an ECG. Once this was done she presented it to the GP who again took time out of his day and after reviewing the results outlined clearly what was happening to me and that we need to call an ambulance. An ambulance was called and I was transferred straight away to the ED of the big base hospital in Ballarat where the care I received was no where near as comprehensive or caring as Ballan. I must also admit that I have previously excellent levels of care at Ballan Community Clinic where I have been able to see a physio, podiatrist, dietician (all 3 on the same day, one after the other! ! ) and I have also been able to see an optometrist and have hearing tests conducted all without having to leave Ballan. Having recently moved to the area we are so very lucky to have access to all these appointments in our own town.

It was 11:30 when a nurse practitioner came in and said we could go after a panadol was given, he was rude and never seemed to know what he was doing. What a disgracefull hospital there, we will never ever go there again which is scary and to think it's so close. In my opinion a vet could be better.

Title: Injury exacerbated while having an Xray at the Sunshine Coast Radiology.
Time: 2013-08-22T15:28:15Z
Location: Sunshine Coast Radiology;
Author: the patient
Story: I regularly see a physiotherapist for right side neck/shoulder problems related to several old injuries and radio therapy 20 years ago. Around Jan 2012 I was having neck pain and my wonderful private physio suggested I get an Xray of my neck so she could check for degeneration as I was over 60. With a referral from my GP I went to Sunshine Radiology in Nambour, Qld. The very young Xray technician did not seem friendly or chatty as technicians usually are. I tried to tell him a bit of the history of that shoulder and neck injury but he was not interested. He ordered me to stand here, stand there etc. The room was darkened and I couldn't see very well. At one stage he seemed annoyed that I couldn't stand in the position he wanted and he said, hold out your right hand which I did. Then he said hold this as he put a cloth handle over my hand - it turned out to be attached to a very heavy sand bag. My whole arm was suddenly wrenched. I was upset and told him my arm hurt. He said nothing. The following week when I took the Xrays to the physio I thought she gaped as I walked in the door and asked me what had happened. I told her and also that it was uncomfortable and I couldn't lift anything or do my wall push-up exercises. She said my right shoulder was 20cms lower than it had been the week before. She turned me around and through my clothing she could see a hole in the muscle above the scapular. She said I'd a torn the long thoracic nerve and had a 'winged' scapular. Back to the GP, who didn't examine me, but said I should be okay though it would take at least two years to heal. I phoned the Xray company headquarters - the manager was away on holidays so I talked to the Workplace Health and Safety officer who listened, said she knew which technician it was and that he was 'young' and would be spoken to. I reminded her that usually healthy people do not need Xrays so any patients they had were probably already injured and that people over 60, or even over 50, should be treated with respect for their physical age and this should be mentioned in training. She seemed to agree with me and said the manager would contact me when back from holidays. I've never heard from them again. I still have problems with that shoulder, I was forced to make changes in my work duties and the injury is still included in my on-going therapy ... at my expense. I have not been able to lie on that side since the injury and have trouble pushing with the right arm. I still use this Xray company as it is conveniently within walking distance of my doctor and the other people working there are very pleasant, thoughtful and friendly. But, I think the management could have shown some interest in my injury, at least follow up by phone. I'd like to warn other people to be careful and not assume that a technician of any sort will have an understanding of previous injuries or disabilities.

Story: In August I arrived with my husband who was 3 days post op from laminectomy surgery at a private hospital in Brisbane with approx 1/4 cup of fluid in his back plaster, white in complexion and severe headache. (We were advised on discharge Saturday if he has increased headaches and / or fluid in the plaster we should present to our closest ED). As I drove down to the ED I could see many people in the waiting room. I managed to get him out of the car. We stood and on our turn we approached a mature age triage nurse who appeared to be quite annoyed by my husbandâ€™s non verbal's. I advised this staff member of my husbandâ€™s name, explained that he was 3 days post op and that he might have a possible CSF leak while asking my husband to turn around to show the triage nurse (that was all I said). We were confronted by a sharp angry reply â€œ.... You donâ€™t diagnose .....â€? this staff member looked down and mumbled under their breath then, without looking, asked â€œwhat's your name?â€?, I answered for my husband, the triage nurse quickly looked up glared and then directed the same question to my husband. (Now at this point my husband is having trouble standing) .... this questioning continued for up to 2 minutes. The triage nurse told my husband to sit down and wait to be called. Sit down! ! ! Really, 3 days post op laminectomy, really.... so he leans up against the window while I give his details to the admin officer.... she advises me that there will be a wait, I stressed to her again 3 days post op and that he could not sit. After 10 minutes and my husband becoming more unsteady on his feet I run and get the car and take him to the Royal Brisbane Hospital where we were seen as soon as we arrived. My husband is still in hospital after having surgery to repair his spinal cord membrane which had deteriorated, followed by lumbar drain. We acknowledge how busy the Redcliffe ED was, however the triage nurseâ€™s attitude was appalling. Maybe the staff at Redcliffe ED should take lessons on how to communicate with people and how awful we felt and uncared for we were. If this triage nurse did not want to be at work, then I suggest they go and find another job. I believe this triage nurse put my husband at risk. What would have happened if he fell over! We will never use the Redcliffe hospital ever again!

Author: the patient
Story: I presented at the Wagga Base hospital with an ankle injury. It was a busy night and I was seen by the nurse who ordered an xray and told me that they were busy and there would be a significant wait time. Within the first hour I had an x-ray and then waited a further 5 hours to see a doctor. My problem is not with how long I had to wait, but how I was treated by the doctor when he finally did see me. The doctor opened the door and asked me to come through. When I expressed that it was difficult for me to walk as I had an ankle injury and would like a wheel chair he told me to get a move on and just walk on it. I was in pain and unable to apply much pressure on my foot so relied on my friend to "walk" to the doctor. The doctor then proceeded to make me "walk" into the main desk area to look at the films from the x-ray to demonstrate that there was not a break. I asked him if it was potentially soft tissue or ligament damage and he said that it wasn't and just a light sprain, told me to just wait for the swelling to go down and keep walking on it. In the 3 minutes that the doctor spend with me, he did not look at my actual ankle, only to x-ray films. Therefore I do not think he could have seen the significant swelling and bruising that had started to come out. I was also not given any recommendation to follow up with a physiotherapist. I have since self referred to a physio who has diagnosed a significant sprain with torn ligaments. The doctor made me feel an absolute fool and like I had sat around wanting my ankle to be broken for 5 1/2 hours. This is not the case. I don't feel that it is asking too much for a doctor to make a full examination of an injury before making a diagnosis or judgement. I would also appreciate that a doctor have a little more tact and consideration for patients.

Story: In March I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks which complicated three weeks later when I was admitted to the surgical ward with excessive bleeding and had to have the miscarriage concluded. The staff I saw those few days were fantastic, and told me that I should immediately return if I was in severe pain. My complaint relates to how I was treated when a few days later I presented at ER again in excruciating pain, which for me was as painful as labour pain. I couldn't even walk unassisted, and although I saw there was literally no patients in the ER department waiting or being treated, I still was left in a cold overlit room for a very long time and then when the doctor came, he seemed to sneer at me . Then he had the audacity to ask me why I was crying, and when I told him I'd just had a miscarriage and was in a lot of pain, he told me I was overreacting and should have stayed home. I had to hobble outside and wait in the cold for my husband to come (he had to take our toddler to my parents). Thankfully the next day my doctor was much more understanding and gave me antibiotics. While it wasn't a life threatening condition, I was only doing what I was told, and I do feel that I was treated appallingly and I would never go to the Armidale ER under any conditions. My doctor has given me their surgery's after hours number, so it won't matter, but I think some doctors need to learn to realise that a patient usually doesn't have medical training and they need to be treated with understanding, particularly if they've just been through something traumatic.

Title: Swan district hospital, lack care, no communication, kicked out far from home
Time: 2013-09-07T11:35:15Z
Location: Swan District Hospital;
Author: the patient
Story: I was transferred to Swan District hospital from the local country hospital by ambulance for a huge abscess needing surgery. To my knowledge it was arranged so that the staff at the hospital were aware I was coming and that they were waiting for me so I should see someone fairly soon due to my condition at the time. I arrived at 2pm through the ambulance entrance. I had not had anything to drink since 8am and had a drip connected. They turned off the drip, put me in a wheelchair and sat me in a waiting area but every time someone opened the toilet door too far it whacked the abscess if I did not manage to stop it. So I waited, and waited. I was not given any pain relief, checked on or had the drip reactivated for the hours I waited. Eventually I was taken into a room where I was told that I was not expected, there was no paperwork, and I had to go through full triage then wait my turn. I insisted on pain relief and demanded that they find the paperwork. I felt that I was being called a liar when I said that I had been transferred by ambulance, through the ambulance entrance, and the paperwork should all be there unless it was lost. When they found it, I was transferred into emergency. At 6.30pm it seemed that word came through that everything had to hurry because they were waiting for me in surgery and they had been looking for me. I was taken into a ward at 6. 30pm, a nurse with a strong accent (that I could not understand) came along and told me to rush through filling in paperwork and get changed. Another nurse came and took over I think because it was taking too long because I could not understand the other nurse. By 7pm I was rushed out into surgery. On the outside of a door into the theatres there was a sign that people with allergies must wear a red cap. I pointed out to staff that as I had an allergy so I should have a red cap. It seemed to me that they did not know what I was talking about. Only when they went back and looked did it seem that they knew I was right so they changed it. About 8pm I was back in the ward. A tray was put beside the bed with sandwiches, ice cream and juice on it. An oxygen mask was put on my face, and I was told it was not to be removed. Half an hour later a nurse asked why I was not eating and drinking! 6. 30am the next morning I was given pain relief and told it was to cover a dressing change and shower. That never happened until 11am with no further pain meds. About 10am I was told they were putting the discharge papers together. I asked how I was to get home, and was told it was not up to them. They can only transport city people. I live a way outside of Perth. They eventually gave me a cab charge to Midland station and was told to get myself somewhere from there. 1pm they asked why I was still there because I should have been gone. I told them I was still waiting for the paperwork to come, which they tried to say I had been given. I overheard the staff talking outside the room and I believe they said the papers had been given to someone, and if it was not me then they did not have an idea who it was. So much for privacy. At 2pm I was put into a taxi and told to find my way home. I had no further pain relief, and there was only one train that comes back here which does not leave until 5. 50pm and gets in at 7.10pm. I was told to entertain myself until then. Luckily I had enough to pay for the train and to get a taxi home from the local station, or I would have been stranded and had to try and get strangers to pay for me. It was just 18 hours from getting out of surgery to being kicked out on the streets alone far from home, in pain. By the time I managed to get home, I was sick, in pain, and had major swelling to the leg. To me it appeared obvious that this was apparently an acceptable way to treat a patient.

Story: I went to the doctor to get a pap smear. The doctor was male, he seemed to hesitate to give me a pap smear and said there was no nurse here to give it to me. I have had pap smears by male doctors before so I didn't see the problem, I said it would be fine if he did it, he said okay I have done hundreds, no thousands of pap smears. I got up on the bed, and first thing he did was put a large amount of gel on me, which was "wiped" on - gross. Then he stuck his finger in me, I yelled out, and he said oh don't worry, that is just my finger. What the hell. He moved it around and then pulled it out and put the speculum in, he then took at least 20 mins getting the sample, back and forth to his desk, leaving me lying there with my legs open - it was horrible. He then tried to wipe off the gel, which was disgusting. I told him to stop. I left feeling very upset about it, especially the finger part.

Author: a relative
Story: My father had a stroke and was transferred from the nursing home to the hospital. The care provided by the staff there was excellent. I was impressed too with their attitude towards family and relatives who visited my father. I would have to say it was a pleasant and welcoming experience. The only thing I would say is that it would have been exceptional care if the staff would stop to check with visitors if they needed any help. Staff appeared busy so it felt a bit awkward for some of my relatives to ask them about my father, or even which room he was in. I know hospitals aren't hotels, but I've been to hotels where everyone (from the cleaners to the managers) say hello and you feel welcomed. Whilst this hospital was above average on this front, it could certainly take a lesson from the hotel industry in being proactive in welcoming its guests.

Story: I received an appointment after a good 8 year waiting period for a progressive degenerative disease that has impacted unilateral on my physical ability and now bilateral with permanent compression impingement making me limp when I try to stand or walk.... The PA Hospital sends a letter to confirm my first appointment. I telephoned to confirm, and the staff just bluntly asked, in what seemed a demanding way, if I wanted this appointment or not and if I didn't, I wouldn't get another option if I could not make it.. So I accepted. A week later another appointment letter arrives, for confirmation for the same appointment early October. I telephoned again and confirmed this appointment again, and was told that they do not know why this has happened and that the early October appointment was confirmed once again over the telephone... A few days later another letter arrives for confirmation of an appointment in late September. I telephoned and inform them that I have already confirmed an appointment for early October and could we just leave it at this... It was confirmed to me that it was an error and that early October is the scheduled appointment at the Neurology Department outpatients specialists PA Hospital. A few days ago, I received a text message asking me to confirm the late September appointment and if I did not want this to ring and cancel. I telephoned and discussed that they were confusing me and I have already confirmed the early October appointment. I found the administration staff member not very caring. It was explained to me that the reason that changes are made is because the specialists are not available on that particular day. I calmly told the staff member that I had already confirmed an appointment for early October, but I felt I was ignored. I left the telephone conversation, confirming the late September appointment and I informed them that I will bring all appointment letters in on that day as well. I simply have no faith or trust in the health care public system Keep this in mind when attending public health care hospital appointments; I believe records speak more than words...

Story: I recently had major surgery in a private hospital. The hospital has a private pharmacy attached to the hospital. This pharmacy provides the discharge medications. On the morning of my discharge the pharmacist visited my room and explained I would be discharged on an antibiotic. He had the prescription in his hand. I looked at the price. It was about $19. I thought that sounded expensive so I questioned it. He agreed that the medication was labelled as a non generic medication when in fact it was a generic brand I declined the medication and asked my doctor for a script so I could get it filled on the way home. I paid $7 for a generic medication. The difference was $12. I have no problem paying for convenience or clinical education but think this is over the top. I have checked and it is not legal to charge for a main brand and supply a generic.

Story: I'll make this a quick one. I've seen a number of GP's in my life but none came close to the level of genuine care and interest provided by my doctor at a Cleveland General Practice. If ever there is a moment I have spent waiting a little longer for an appointment, it's not because they're overbooked, I believe it's because the doctor isn't rushing patients in and out to increase billable hours, in my experience it's because he spends an extra moment to ensure his patients, like me receive the treatment most suitable to them and actually understand their treatment. The reception staff are always accommodating and helpful and the practice is always kept extremely presentable. Couldn't be happier.

My husband has had a lot of health problems and suffers from depression, weighed over 100kg and has previously found it difficult to get up off the couch and move around. We were encouraged to see Kay who has motived us to move more by going for walks etc. Since then my husband and daughters have all lost weight and go walking together and generally feel better. My husband's mood also seems to have improved and he doesn't spend as much time sitting down as he used to. My daughter's confidence also appears to have improved. We are definitely more motivated and healthier since Kay has come into our lives. Sometimes we meet up with her for lunch, she is a really nice person and is really involved with our family and is always encouraging us every step of the way. Kay always seems to go out of her way, she will visit or call us just to check in and make sure we have been to our various appointments.

Location: Royal North Shore Hospital;
Author: the patient
Story: I had an appointment with Community Health, which is in a different, neighbouring building to the main hospital. Unfortunately, my good friend, trying to prevent me getting wet, delivered me to the main entrance at the opposite end of the hospital. I thought I knew where I was going, so without making inquiries I walked to the last of three lifts and, with others, descended two floors. The corridors are white and there is signage, but nothing that was relevant to me. I passed the Oncology Outpatients Service, and the next sign that I saw told me that I was approaching the morgue. I also passed an acute mental health facility. But there didn't appear to be signage for the Community Health building, and I was now lost and confused. I knew there was a path between the two buildings, but I could not find it. I asked a passing person, who kindly said that they were also lost. Their badge suggested that they were an employee! I tried to return the way that I had come, but the door would not open. It required a pass. In the end I asked a passing doctor. He suggested that I use a lift further away than the one I had come down. I didn't have the right pass to get up the lift. I was told to wait until someone else arrived who was travelling upwards. Fortunately, an orderly and a wheelchair came fairly soon. They pressed the lift buttons, and I requested the entry floor. I retraced my steps and sought directions at the security window. It was suggested that I walk around the outside of the hospital past ED, which may have been easier. I do not believe I could be the only person who has made this mistake. Perhaps some signposting is needed to redirect outpatients seeking Community Health Services. The windowless white corridors in the basements have a sameness that only the coloured lifts help to break. I discovered how easy it is for patients to move into 'sealed' spaced through pass-protected doors simply by moving through with another person. I wasn't alarmed or scared, but I did have an appointment, and I was worried about missing my consultant! I think signage should not only be for those who are where they should be; it is even more important for people who inadvertently find themselves where they were not intended to be. After my appointment I returned by the basement route and, although it can be confusing in the area around Radiotherapy due to the number of warnings, the reverse journey was more intuitive and easier to navigate.

Other times we have been waiting with two diabetes nurses, who usually take our blood pressure and sometimes weigh us, for the lady to open up and when she does turn up she has said that she never had keys so she was unable to open up and we couldn't go in. I have to put petrol in my car to drive there (to the program) as I live out of town but recently when I got there it has not been open. I didn't get told or know that the lady wasn't going to be there. I find this very inconsistent and inconvenient.

Author: the patient
Story: St Andrews private hospital in Spring Hill advertises itself as 'first class treatment', 'world class results' - but this is not what I have experienced. Nine days later I am still waiting to be called back and given the appointment I have requested. Initially I rang and could not get through; so I rang the next day and the phone extension just went repeatedly to a message bank service. In fact on that day I rang no less than four times and in the final message in exasperation specifically stating that I needed to be called back - I was never called back! Four (4) days later [including Saturday and Sunday] I rang in the hope of making an appointment to begin the program; but no such luck. However, I did get a staff member to actually answer the phone, so that was an improvement I thought - but not for long. The clerk told me they were 'busy' on the day I had called and said we were 'going to call you back' - I thought it best not to ask exactly when they planned to do that. Could I arrange an appointment; no I could not - why on earth would I think it would be that easy! Apparently I had to go and scan my referral and then email it to the unit and the 'manager' would look at it and decide when I could get an appointment. I told the clerk I had been in the hospital recently for lung problems and they had my file - she decided that she would get my file and give it to the 'manager' and I should mail the referral in. I went to great lengths to explain that time was of the premium for me and I needed an appointment to begin this program immediately; or as soon as humanly possible - although by this stage I was of the view that I probably would receive better service in an overcrowded public hospital service. The clerk told me that the 'manager' would ring me - she took a message that she promised to pass on which said I needed; because of times restrictions, to be called back within 24 hours; certainly no more than 36 hours. I am still waiting for the phone call, still waiting for an appointment some nine (9) days later. While I think this outpatient program would be of considerable value to me; I had a lung deflate recently - the failure of the unit to be managed properly is of grave concern. If they cannot call people back when requested; or even arrange an appointment what else are they unable to do? I also previously wanted to attend a similar clinic for heart matters run at St Andrews; but that unit moved from St Andrews to the Wesley several months ago supposedly because of inadequate numbers - if staff do not answer the phone or return phone calls I don't think hospitals will not receive the 'business' they are seeking. Please pass this on to the person with higher status than the 'manager' who was suppose to ring me back.

I had placenta precreta as a result of the placenta going through the uterus into the uterine artery, bladder and bowel. As a result I had a Caesarian hysterectomy (and hernia op at the same time) all because, I think, the dr had not done more intensive MRI testing (which the mater hospital did do when I was transferred there on my request). I felt the dr insisted this wasn't needed and he would see what was happening when he cut me (horizontally) open. Had I not moved under the care of the mater hospital Brisbane, I do not believe I would have been alive today. I attribute my life to them, vertical scar and all.

Author: the patient
Story: I had a septoplasty performed at St Andrews Hospital Toowoomba. They have a system where all surgical patients must go through the day surgery entrance, be interviewed, then changed in to surgical clothing before sitting in recliners to await surgery time. I had to sit in a recliner from 7: 00am to past 2pm before finally being taken to a waiting area outside the operating theatres where I had to wait another hour. All this time, my wife had no idea where I was. As far as she knew, I was in surgery. She, however, was able to wait in the room that was allocated to me when she returned after midday. Why couldn't I have been allocated that room and been able to wait there for my surgery? When I arrived in the room drowsy from surgery, I found everything in the wrong place. I went to the ensuite toilet and when I washed my hands, the towels were not there; they were in my room on a bench instead. When in bed and I need tissues, they were not by my bed, they were over on the bench on the other side of the room. The drip machine was plugged in to power ports inside a cupboard high on the wall so when I needed to unplug the machine to go to the toilet, it was quite a contortionist act to achieve. The dinner time meal was three tiny triangle sandwiches. I felt all round disorganised and poor, particularly considering how much my health fund would have been paying in charges. The next morning, I had to have packs removed from my nose which is extremely painful. I had been given a painkiller in the morning. When the packs were removed, I was in such intense pain that it felt like the inside of my nasal passages was on fire. I asked for another painkiller. The nurse told me I couldn't have another as I had been given one a short while ago. Later in the morning, I am discharged and given a box of the strong painkillers. The labelled doctor's instruction: take ONE OR TWO, so I could have been given a second one by the nurse.

He was in casualty for 12 hrs until a bed became available in a ward which was at about 5.00am. I saw him at 8.00am where attempts had been made to obtain bloods but my understanding was that his veins had collapsed. Eventually blood was taken. At about 10.00am a person who I believed to be an administrator saw him, said what is he doing here we need that bed and discharged him. I felt that he was not allowed to get dressed in the ward. He was wheeled by a volunteer to a departure area where he was forced to get dressed in public toilets. The lovely volunteer assisted in getting his medication and helped him into my car for the 45 minute trip him. He was very ill for the first week and I had to call another ambulance. He was off work for approximately five weeks.

I was upset and annoyed that I had to go through that. I have met some of the nicest midwives at that hospital but now after everything if I had another baby I would avoid that hospital.

Author: the patient
Story: I went to emergency at the Royal Melbourne Hospital after being unable to sip water or even swallow my own saliva for 6 days straight after my lap band became too tight and cut off the entrance to my stomach. I had waited that long because the band becoming tight when I'm sick or something irritates it isn't unusual, and it usually settles in a few days. This time it didn't. I had begun to get serious dehydration symptoms including blurred vision, severe insomnia and confusion. I was also suffering from asthma and was having difficulty breathing - I needed some fluid taken out of my band (a simple needle into a port under my skin to withdraw some fluid). The Triage nurse didn't touch me, examine me or or even look at me when she spoke to me. I told her all my symptoms and history - her reply was, and I QUOTE "Doctors here don't like lap bands, we don't have anyone who would treat you". I pressed her and she repeated the same, that lap bands were unpopular at Melbourne Hospital, doctors at Melbourne hospital did not agree with them and would not treat me. I asked for a needle so I could take out the fluid myself (at this point I was desperate for water), she refused. At no point did she offer a drip or anything else. At no point did she consult anyone else in the hospital, as I specifically asked her to do. I then repeated my breathing difficulties and repeated my asthmatic history - she ignored me and did not check my breathing (even after I asked specifically for her to do so). She offered no alternative. It appeared that I was ushered out so the next person could be seen. I had difficulty getting home due to confusion and a couple of hours later I was experiencing increased delirium, increased breathing rate, tingling in my hands and feet and had not peed for two full days! (all signs, I believe, of serious dehydration). The following morning friends got me to a doctor who took some fluid out of my band - relief was instant and I was immediately able to drink. I wrote a written formal complaint to the hospital with details of the experience, including my name, date and time I saw the nurse, via email. 8 weeks later I still had not heard from them and contacted them again asking if they had investigated the incident. Their response (also in email), was to let them know if I still wanted to pursue a reply, as I felt they implied it wasn't important and they didn't feel a reply was necessary. Clearly, they hadn't done a thing. I still have the emails.

Story: I was admitted to the ER at Flinders Medical Centre after suffering an epileptic seizure. After spending a number of hours on a bed in the ER and being examined by a number of doctors I was told I didnâ€™t suffer a seizure because I could walk during the seizure. I would soon be discharged as there was no reason to keep me there. The next thing I remember is waking up the next day in another ward. I was told I had another seizure and they were keeping me for observation. My back hurt very badly and it was x-rayed. I was told I had a spinal fracture but I was told nothing further about the injury and the x-rays would be sent to my GP for follow up. I also informed them of very bad pain in my shoulder but it seems they refused to look at it and told me I must also follow this up with my GP when I was discharged. An EEG and MRI were conducted and the results were discussed with me afterwards. I was told by a doctor they could see no signs of my epilepsy (which I have been suffering since childhood). Upon discharge I asked the nursing staff for my shoes but they could not find them. They spent what seemed over an hour searching and returned to me telling me they could not be found. I was given zero follow up appointments or information regarding what had happened and was basically sent home with what I felt was NO information. I went to my GP a week later and told her information was sent to her by the hospital and I was interested in my back xray results. She told me the hospital sent nothing to her but a brief summary of my stay and that she could not help me.

At around 7.00am I knew I was going into shock as my temperature dropped and I was shaking uncontrollably. A friend drove me to the ER and waited. I was met by a what seemed to me to be a very rude and disinterested triage nurse who decided I must have had a "big night", and made me sit in the waiting room, where I continued to vomit, was incontinent and almost passed out from the pain. After an hour in the waiting room with no other patients waiting I was finally taken to the ER ward, where the nursing staff and doctor on duty were exceptional and admitted me to an isolation room. I have had a previous experiences where the on call doctor, nurses and triage nurse were uncaring and dismissive. Armidale ER need to get their act together and realise that if people come in who are that ill they should be treated!

Location: The Alfred Hospital;
Author: the patient
Story: I went to professionals over and over- exhausted, crying, low concentration... told to exercise, take vitamins and anti depressants...couldn't exercise, too lethargic. Doctors made me feel terrible for this, like wasn't trying to help myself. Anti depressants made me incontinent and more depressed, suicidal, like killing myself would be for the best. Went to different doctors, hospitals when suicidal, felt I was treated terribly- like it was my fault I wasn't doing the right thing for my depression. The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne saw me twice when I was suicidal. I felt I was treated like I was wanting attention, given a valium and sent home with a stern talking to, intimated I had wasted their time. Eventually I had pains through my whole body, could barely get out of bed, I lost my career and most of my friends. I felt I was still treated as a malingerer that wasn't trying to help myself and if I said anti depressants weren't working was told I was wrong- they worked according to doctors. Pretended to take them. Took the prescription and threw it in the bin outside doctor's office, or the doctor(s)it seemed would treat me like I was just taking up their time with my rubbish depression problem. A doctor finally tested my thyroid. That's all it was. All that wasted time, all those doctor visits where they would treat me like I wasn't helping myself. A career down the drain, relationships destroyed, suicide attempts, a life lost. How was I meant to know? I felt was treated terribly, like a malingerer. All I wanted was to be better, Not one (except the last one) tested my thyroid- I had every symptom of a low thyroid except one- I didn't gain weight. How easy would it have been. How much pain would have been avoided, by a simple blood test. I have called every single doctor that I saw to tell them- test thyroid of any depressed person, it could bypass years of pain. Three of those doctors had the gall to say 'you would have been depressed anyway'... really? Actually, no. I nearly lost my life and I lost everything else.

Title: Months of crippling pain endured as Sunshine Hospital sticks to its guidelines
Time: 2013-10-25T15:17:30Z
Location: Sunshine Hospital;
Author: the patient
Story: I started having severe bleeding and uterine contractions whenever ovulation occurred. It was the worst pain of my life, akin to going through labour/childbirth, and it went on for ages. It was crippling, scary, ruining my life, recurrent, and the first time it happened it went on for A NUMBER OF DAYS (imagine being in labour that long, almost a week! ). I went to my local doctor, who sent me to a specialist, who I took weeks to get an appointment with, because my part of Melbourne is very, very short on specialists (back then, I actually thought that was a long wait! ). He thought it was possibly a uterine cyst, but given that my grandmother died young from uterine cancer, he wanted it checked out asap, with an operation to both investigate and remove it. (It was impossible to see exactly what it was in scans. ) I immediately sent off my referral to Sunshine Hospital, and waited...and waited...and waited. I contacted Sunshine Hospital to see when I would likely be seen for the operation and was informed that hospital guidelines meant they couldn't even LOOK at my referral letter until two months after I sent it in, and wouldn't assess the need or urgency of my case until then. After two months, they finally looked at the referral letter, classed me as a class A emergency (the most urgent) but even then it took two more months to be booked in for the operation - in other words, I waited four months in all from the time I asked them for the surgery. All the while, I was getting this horrible crippling uterine pain over and over (going into long and painful labour pains every three or four weeks is NOT something I would wish even on my worst enemy). I have an allergy to most painkillers too, so there was no relief for me there. It was truly awful. Every month, I knew I would soon ovulate and the pain would be back again - I lived in fear of it, and had to plan ahead for days of not being able to get out of bed and look after myself. I would only know an approximate time of when it would be due (I don't ovulate like clockwork) so I would have to make sure I was at home for about a week or more mid-cycle, because I couldn't be out when it hit - I couldn't move or walk with pain like that, and I would bleed profusely with it. And all the while, I was living in great fear in case it was cancer, and fretted I would die like my grandmother before me. I finally got the surgery after waiting four months after seeing the specialist. They were nice at the hospital, though they seemed to forget to call my contact number and tell them to come and collect me, so I was still there waiting and woozy at closing time and didn't get to go home until evening, in peak hour traffic, which took double the time it should and I wanted to throw up the entire way home. Luckily, I found out after the operation that I did not have cancer (though I was told I did have some pre-cancerous cell changes in the uterus so I'm not out of the woods for future problems), but I wish I hadn't had to wait so long and endure such awful pain to find out! If it had been cancer, I would have been in a lot of trouble after them letting it continue to grow for all those extra months. One last sting in the tail: the hos I think the hospital gave me a big fat case of MRSA to take home with me. I am still trying to cure that. The antibiotics almost killed me, but they didn't kill the MRSA. I have spent about a thousand dollars on various treatments to try to get rid of it, both natural and prescribed, both oral and topical, but nothing has entirely worked yet. So I have a lovely lasting legacy of that. And one more thing - every time I went to the hospital, the entrance was packed with smokers all puffing away. I am allergic to smoke, and it made me very ill - and one especially doesn't want to go into surgery feeling ill like that. I complained repeatedly, but it seemed like they did nothing. I think many of the smokers were hospital staff. Someone there actually scratched out the NO in the NO SMOKING sign outside the hospital, so it read SMOKING. I don't think you should allow smoking like that around sick people and newborns, especially when you're aware people are getting very ill from it. It was a violation of my rights as a disabled person (my allergy to smoking is that severe! ) and I don't feel my complaining about it was taken at all seriously. You'd think a hospital of all places would take it more seriously!

Title: Redcliffe hospital not understaffed, just under-caring
Time: 2013-10-25T15:27:12Z
Location: Royal Children's Hospital;Redcliffe Hospital;
Author: a parent/guardian
Story: Twice we have taken our little 2 year old boy to Redcliffe hospital in Queensland. Twice, it seems, he was treated as inconsequential. First time he had a 40 degree temperature and was left in the waiting room for four hours without admission, even though it appeared the temperature did not respond to treatment. And just now we raced him to the hospital for a broken leg. We stood in line for ten minutes, a man was waiting casually in front of us while six nursing staff seemed to stare at their desks and shuffle papers. Eventually we gave up and raced him to Royal Childrens, where the doctors and staff are wonderful. Every time we take our kids to Redcliffe hospital we seem to get the same stuff, disinterested, uncaring and monotone responses. We aren't there for fun. We expect just a little humanity and attentiveness. And I'm sick of hearing them whinge about staff cuts and crap. Every time I've been there, it appears that there are literally swathes of nurses wandering around. But every chance they get they bang on about staff cuts and government cost cutting. It's like they are doing us a huge favour, like they're a charity. I think they're just interested in themselves and their jobs, not patients.

Title: Severe pain in lower bowels fails to set off alarm bells at Gold Coast Hospital

Location: Gold Coast University Hospital;
Author: the patient
Story: I went to Gold Coast Hospital on a Tuesday afternoon with massive pains on the left hand side of my lower bowels. At about 2.00am Wednesday I was told that I had diverticulitis and was sent home after a Panadol was given to me and a pack of antibiotics. This was done by the medical registrar of the night. The next evening being Wednesday at about 6.30 pm the pain was still there and a fever at around 39 degrees was diagnosed by me at home. I returned to the Gold Coast Hospital and at about 10.00 pm was told that I had formed an abscess on my bowel were the diverticulitis was and it had burst, thus filling my body up with faeces. This had reached my lunges by this time. I was told it was serious and that I had a 10% chance of dying. Thank God they started 3 sets of different antibiotics, thus killing the germs and my bowels repairing themselves. I went home a week later. The medical registrar of the Tuesday night was there again on the Wednesday night. It seemed she did not have the hide to approach me as she had nearly sent me to my grave. I put my complaint in and never heard a thing back from it.

I now have constant neuropathic pain in my palm; problems with my Ulnar and Radial nerves; the procedure on my thumb (despite it being explained in person and in detail by the surgeon himself - post surgery) appears was not recorded in my file; stitches were installed in the base of the wound and attached to a tendon - also appears not to be noted; "urgent" Occupational Therapy took 9 weeks to happen. In the meantime, my wrist was unable to flex and my fingers began to curl inwards; repeat visits usually conclude with "Come back in 4 weeks and we'll see what's happening"; fingers and thumb randomly spasm and lose grip and, on my last visit, I was told in no uncertain terms that "Nothing was done to your thumb, if it had been it WOULD have been recorded" and that I was "obviously mistaken". 5 months later and I'm unable to go back to work and unable to pay my bills.

My daughter has 75% cirrhosis of her liver along with multiple complications and at the age of 23 will required a liver transplant. He was reluctant to give us her blood results despite her being in the care of a professor and felt he could handle the situation.

Title: Breast is best brigade frowns on our decision to bottle feed our newborn.
Time: 2013-10-25T19:59:14Z
Location: The Wesley Hospital;The Wesley Hospital / Maternity care;
Author: a relative
Story: This happened a little while ago now, I have only just discovered this website so I thought I would comment as we are considering where to have our second child. When we had our son at the Wesley, the actual birth was fantastic, the midwife and our obs/gyn were amazing and seemed to look after my wife so well. However when we got to the maternity ward I thought it all went downhill. As bub had latching issues, I believe the midwife was meant to be called every time he needed a feed. We had to explain the situation to every single midwife/nurse that attended over the course of 4 days, EVERY SINGLE ONE this included at 3am in the morning and a majority of them seemed to be annoyed by the fact. We never saw the same midwife/nurse twice so it was very frustrating and upsetting to my wife in having a different method/technique each and every time to the point of us actually leaving early. I think several of the midwives got a bit short with my wife during attempts to get him to latch. I do not think she received her regular pain relief and had to buzz for it, EVERY TIME, and before you ask it was not a PRN med, it was regular and our gynae confirmed it. The lactation consultation visited us just before we left even though we had requested it earlier and we discovered that the staff had been using incorrect techniques for most of our stay. Once we had decided to change to bottle feeds it was like we had signed our souls to the devil, " The breast is best mafia brigade" appeared. We were handed a couple of bottles of formula then told we needed to provide our own. I fully understand and accept this with no issue, however felt there was a negative attitude that was absolutely astounding! My wife felt like a very second class citizen for not breast feeding and they seemed to continually try to get her to keep trying. I understand the midwives are "independent practitioners" however if they are going to work in a ward environment there should be some cohesion to how they approach issues. It was overall a very disappointing stay. I felt I needed to say something because I imagine there are other mothers out there who have difficulty and should not have to suffer for it. I believe my wife still feels terrible to this day after how they made her feel.

Story: When a female patient was presented to emergency ward staff by a friend who had found her unconscious in her home after being alerted by a prior phone call asking for assistance, it seemed that the patient was forced to wait 8 hours for a bed. More to the point, the patient was experiencing severe abdominal pain and it appeared was denied pain relief beyond Panadol for 72 hours. The pain was so severe that the patient was routinely unable to stop moving her legs. Hospital staff and doctors openly told the patient and attending friend that they believed her to be drug seeking despite some quite obvious pain centred on abdomen. On the 5th day tests confirmed appendicitis requiring immediate surgery.

Story: I was suffering from chest tightness and shortness of breath. My cardiologist referred me to the Lyell McEwin Hospital for an angiogram. The angiogram consequently revealed I had a partially blocked coronary artery which required stunting. I have nothing but praise for the way I was treated, from the nursing staff to the surgeon. The nursing staff were compassionate and caring, the surgeon explained what was going to happen during the procedure. Upon leaving the hospital I received a phone call to ask how I was going. I attended their cardiac rehabilitation program after and have nothing but praise for Sue, the program coordinator. I have always been a bit hesitant and nervous about attending hospitals but my procedure and stay at this hospital was first class.

Story: My ex-son-in-law was regularly hospitalised (he's given up now, it seems that the Dr's still don't know what is wrong with him) & we think during that time contracted VRE. From our understanding this means he was supposed to be isolated in hospital & the emergency cubicle/room fully cleaned before anyone else was put in there. I lost count of the number of times I was sitting in a cubicle waiting for him to be brought back from one procedure or another, with a "stop" sign pinned to the curtain, only to have the staff I saw in emergency remove the sign & tell me he was now in another cubicle, while immediately wheeling another patient into the cubicle without apparently any cleaning having occurred. This is one of the ways VRE is transmitted.

Author: a parent/guardian
Story: I recently had the misfortune of having to access the emergency department at the Kerang hospital. It was for my 6 month old son. On arrival to the emergency department I was asked did I call and I said to the nurse no I did not, she at this point took no details and appeared to continue to hand out cups of tea to patients. She then asked me what I was doing there and I told her my 6 month old had a rash and we were advised by the doctor if it got worse to turn up to the emergency department. She then asked what his name was and disappeared for 10 minutes. I assumed she was getting his emergency record. She came back empty handed in what seemed a very disinterested way. She said I suppose I could do some obs on him but we are not on call this weekend you'll have to take him to Barham. She did not once look at my son and she seemed very uninterested in my son and myself. I felt like I was wasting her time being at the hospital. After her disappointing attitude I took my son to Bendigo hospital where he was seen by a doctor within an hour. I have received a response from the hospital stating the nurse who saw to me said she referred me to a more senior nurse. This was not mentioned to me and I never saw another nurse at the hospital, so I can only assume this was a lie from the nurse to cover up her poor nursing skills. My advice is if you live close to Kerang and need to see a doctor or attend the emergency department drive to Bendigo or Swan Hill don't waste your time at the Kerang Hospital

Location: Lyell McEwin Hospital;
Author: a carer
Story: My husband was severely ill, he was taken into the Lyell McEwin Hospital by his specialist who I believe told the triage nurse what the problem was. I also believe he told her this was an emergency. When he left, I had to tell the triage nurse what the problem was, and then, in my opinion, she made my husband (who could barely stand & didn't seem to understand what was happening) get up & tell her what the problem was. He was then taken into a cubicle which didn't seem clean, no pillow & left there. 5hrs later the first person came in to see him & asked what pain medication he had been given. When I told him "none", he asked again, telling me I hadn't understood what he was asking. He seemed to take blood & then left. During this time my husband "messed" himself, & I was left to get him to a shower, find a gown & get him back to his cubicle & find someone to help me change the sheets. About an hour later a specialist seemingly rushed into the room to draw fluid off my husband's stomach. I believe he gave him local anaesthetic & immediately started to push a large bore needle in & pretty much left me & a staff member to hold my husband down. We were then told a bed would be found for him. He was moved from that side room & left in a cubicle next to paediatric emergency, for 36hrs, with babies constantly crying. From there he was taken to a "ward" (I suggest it was a converted day room) with no natural light & 12 other patients. At the time there was no shower in there & only 1 toilet, & it was behind a locked door. During this time it was left to me to request showers & we'd be taken to another area & left for a shower & were told "don't press the buzzer if there's problems, it's not connected to our area". After 5 days in this ward, I realized that it seemed that the other people who had all been in the same length of time hadn't been taken for showers because there seemed to be only ever 2 nurses to look after 13 patients in that ward. One woman was given a bowl to clean herself & as she moved next to her bed, the curtain kept opening. Meals in this area also seemed to arrive cold & congealed, if he wasn't awake when they were delivered, I donâ€™t believe he wasnâ€™t wakened & they would often remove the food without him having woken. If he missed a meal like this, there was no food on the ward. After he left, I put in a complaint to the hospital that took what I thought was ages to be replied to, with the answers being that they weren't worried about his eating because I was bringing food in (because he wasn't being fed there) & that there was now a shower in the area.

Story: From early August 2012 I began to experience severe nausea and vomiting which resulted in frequent hospital admissions due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. I was put through many tests and procedures to find the cause. Nothing was found. In early September I became even sicker, was diagnosed with Tardive Dyskinesia due to taking Maxalon to treat the nausea and vomiting. The nausea and vomiting continued till late November. It was at this time I realized through reading back through my diary that these symptoms began after my first admission to the cardiac ward where my dose of Lipitor was doubled from 20 to 40 mg. I spoke to my GP and Lipitor was ceased. Almost immediately the symptoms stopped but I am left with disabling symptoms from Tardive Dyskinesia that fluctuate fairly often. I had to retire from work as a carer ( which I loved doing) and now lead a very meager life struggling to manage emotionally and financially. I can't understand why with the multitude of doctors who saw me or the pharmacists didn't pick up on the side effect to Lipitor. I feel devastated as my whole life has been turned upside down

Title: Concerned with basic hygiene at Barwidgee Lodge.

Location: Barwidgee Lodge;
Author: a relative
Story: 1. The staff seemed consistently rude and what I thought was less than could be considered professional when questioned about care by the family. 2. Although the family had supplied suitable clothing, it seemed that staff frequently dressed Mum inappropriately, and what I thought as compromising her dignity and comfort. This has been communicated to staff when observed along with practical advice on application of garments to what seemed no avail. 3. I spoke with the unit manager regarding my motherâ€™s care, specifically the use of the â€œstand upâ€? lifter causing shearing to the front of Mums shins. I suggested padding the front of the lifter to remediate this. The Staff indicated that a physiotherapist assessment had been booked to address these issues. I requested to be present at the appointment to assess any recommendations presented which was acknowledged. The assessment took place and I was informed after the fact, in contradiction to my request. This is one example of the ongoing seemingly exclusion by the staff to participate decision making regarding Mumâ€™s care by the family. A sling lifter was implemented without consultation with the family and it seemed to again be a case of compromising her dignity and further diminishing her mobility. 4. I expressed my concern that it seemed to me that Mum was being left in the wheelchair / Princess chair for excessive periods without change in position. This is what I believe presented as visible pressure sores. I believe this was remediated in this instance although I think shows lack of basic nursing care and should not have occurred. This periodically re-occurs and is I believe unacceptable at any time. 5. An OT assessment was performed at the familyâ€™s request due to concerns re Mumâ€™s deteriorating physical condition including footdrop (which was not present when admitted in 2010) and complete lack of mobility. The resultant report was I believe provided to the unit manager and copied to myself. The recommendations did not seem to be implemented re footdrop and inappropriate princess chair. The princess chair was documented within the OT report as faulty. The Unit Manager indicated that Mum would have to remain in bed after afternoon rest as there was no other chair available. 6. Following the OT assessment, a physiotherapist was engaged with I believe a recommendation of deployment of a footroll whilst in bed. This did not seem to be implemented by the staff contrary to the professional recommendation. In addition, I believe a tilt-in-space wheelchair was recommended as being appropriate for Mum by the physiotherapist. The family presented and supplied numerous options as recommended, all of which appeared vetoed by staff and the OH&S representative, without what appeared to me to be a valid reason or appropriate alternative. 7. On numerous occasions, I did not see afternoon tea provided to Mum. On discussion with the kitchen staff, it was assumed that my Father had supplied and supervised the tea. It should not be assumed that my Father is the primary care provider for basic nutrition and hydration. My Father was present to supplement the expected level of care provided to Mum, not to be sole provider and supervisor. 8. It is observed as an ongoing issue that unresolved wounds are continuing, aided I think by incorrect application of dressings and pressure bandages. 9. My Mum was commenced on a course of antibiotics for wound infection of the shins, three days after being highlighted to the charge nurse. 10. Mum's deteriorating condition and associated concerns as covered in the previous points was discussed with the Unit Manger including the delay in commencement of antibiotics. It was also communicated to the RND1 by my Sister that a rash was present. 11. My Sister received a phone call and then informed me that Mumâ€™s antibiotic course had been discontinued by the attending doctor. I was further informed that Mum had been given an antihistamine. My Sister told me that she had informed the caller that Mum was allergic to antihistamine. As can be seen from our extensive list above, the families basic concern had been Basic Hygiene, Wound and Infection control, mobility, and their impacts on our mothers quality of life and finally the only thing remaining, her dignity.

There was a separate Accident & Emergency area for Paediatrics, which was fantastic. Over the course of the evening there were a few tests such as x-rays and the staff (doctors and nurses) were fantastic throughout. We were made comfortable as much as possible and I was offered coffee and biscuits during my wait. Eventually my son was admitted to the Paediatric Ward and we were there for two nights whilst he received treatment. I was very impressed with all the staff and systems in place. The level of professionalism was amazing. My son was even given a knitted teddy bear from the hospital. Thank you to all the staff and the wonderful work you do.

Story: A few years ago I underwent stomach banding at Austin Hospital Heidelberg. Two years later, after not losing weight, but starting to gain, I got into see the surgeon, and asked if I could have some xray or something to determine why. I had a barrium xray and while I was having it the xray tech asked why I was there. I said "to see if my band was working properly" he seemed to replied - it's not even done up! So the next week I went back and saw the surgeon and told him what the xray guy had said and I remembering him saying to me - of course it's done up, it's just in the wrong place. It seems it had been put at the oesophageal junction instead of around the stomach! Since then I have been fighting to have my lap band removed (I believe it has adhered to connecting tissue of course), and the proper procedure done. I've had more pre op tests, filled out 2 lots of pre op papers, got 2 pre surgery consult dates, and 2 actual surgery dates and I'm still absolutely no where. The trouble is of course, how do you trust a group of people who've done so badly by you in the first place?

Story: I got my lung infection from a rental car on a trip to Brisbane. I was first admitted to hospital there and after about three days I was able to leave with medication (Prednisone). On returning home I was getting better but as soon as the medication finished I deteriorated rapidly and went to Canberra hospital in Woden barely able to breathe. I was admitted into emergency and put in a bed. I was given medication and oxygen to keep my levels up. Shortly after the supervising doctor took me off the oxygen. I was hooked up to the monitor which goes off when the oxygen levels go too low. My alarm began to go off repeatedly and I eventually felt that I was losing consciousness. I asked the nurse to give me oxygen and she went to the doctor three times before it seemed to me that he allowed her to give me oxygen again. I honestly felt that the doctor was depriving me of oxygen on purpose and felt that my life was in danger. I have been admitted for asthma several times over the years and have never felt before that I had been made to suffer on purpose. I was very scared of dying.

The ambulance paramedics (Liam and Tracey) were absolutely wonderful and seemed to listen to what I said and I think treated my husband with the utmost care and respect. He was admitted to Inverell hospital around 1.30am, I could not fault the nursing and medical staff, Dr Thanh Huynh was very kind and considerate and I believe his immediate action helped my husband get through a very difficult time. The hospital itself was exceptionally clean and light and it was great to see beds being washed down as soon as patients left and beds being made tidy often. Nurses were there all the time and seemed to be on the ball. To me, all necessary tests were taken and he was put on high dose antibiotics and methylprednisolone for a period of 5 days. The only thing that was difficult was contacting emergency services to get him to hospital it took me an hour to get a response and then another 45 minuted for the ambulance to arrive (not their fault it is a fair distance to our town). We really need more first response people here and in every small country town, I think we are losing family members due to the time it takes to get adequate treatment. The NSW Government needs to get their act together regarding rural medical services, a couple of nurse practitioners who are allowed to visit patients after hours and an ambulance station in each town would I think help, indenturing graduate doctors to a town at the end of their training and making them stay at least 3 years would give us, I believe, a standard of health like the big cities. (That means service without an escape clause i.e. they will not get their degree until they have satisfactorily completed rural service.

Story: My daughter in law early 2013 had a teenage sibling admitted to Townsville Public Hospital one Friday night for urgent brain surgery after cracking his skull fooling around with his mates. Doctors and nurses were brilliant until the sibling was admitted to the ICU ward for further treatment. Parents went visiting soon after, and discovered the sibling's arm bandaged and when they made an inquiry, was told by a nurse that the sibling crawled out of bed and was found on the floor. It appears there are no nurses on 24/7 bedside watch. We've found out that more than 200 doctors, nurses and allied health staff have been sacked from the Townsville Public Hospital in the last 12 months. I have been told of other incidences.

I was told to go to radiology and book in for a biopsy; I went down there but the earliest I could get an appointment was TWO WEEKS. I was advised that I could try 'over the road' at Epworth Eastern. I did so, and I had the biopsy done immediately. I am lucky that I had private health cover which meant minimal out of pocket expense for the procedure, but I feel sorry for those who don't. Two weeks to wait for a biopsy to confirm cancer is APPALLING.

Location: Gold Coast University Hospital;
Author: the patient
Story: I broke my wrist & after it apparently healed, I went back and complained that I was still in a lot of pain. I feel my pain was dismissed as stiffness resulting from the break. I returned to the hospital another 10 times complaining of pain. After I refused to leave until I was listened to that an X-ray of both my left and right wrists were taken for comparison (at my insistence). Once the x-Ray was reviewed, the specialist seemingly found that my wrist had been set at 40 degree tilt. Over time my tendons have ripped, ligaments have torn, I have damage on my ulna nerve, arthritis in my joint and the specialist also noted that my fracture had not healed correctly. I have undertaken two surgeries since and have been told that more surgery is probable. I have complained to the health commission and an investigation noted that my pain is a result of my initial fracture. This has been a nightmare for me and I still struggle with a lot of pain and am unable to do a lot of task involving my right arm. Surely something so 'simple' could've been picked up on one of the ten occasions I went back to orthopaedic specialists at the hospital?

Story: Despite initial misdiagnose by the GP and poor care and follow up from Wollongong Hospital, my wife's bowel cancer has been in remission for three years. After numerous operations to remove tumours we were told by her Colo Rectal surgeon that he wasn't sure of the next step because he didn't think she would live. Said she should just forget about it and see what happens. Instead she visited Professor Michael Solomon from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He immediately recommended an operation to remove the remaining tumour. Ordered scans, visits to other specialists who would team with him during the op. Had the op at RPA and has since been clear. Professor Solomon a true genius. A man who is involved in clinical research, is/was President of the Australia & New Zealand Colo rectal Surgeons Association, is head of research at Universities (many, many other distinctions - google him). To think that we had access to this genius Doctor within the public hospital system is a wrap for the health system in our State. I know they get bagged for bad experiences, and I think, rightly so, but our experience could not have been better thanks to this gifted Surgeon who I believe saved my wife's life. (She is also a mother of 5, a nanny to several, and a sister to several) and a good person. So if anyone reading this has Bowel Cancer (or other "gut" issues), go see this Surgeon and I think your life will more than likely be saved, if it can be, it will be. RPA - thumbs up.

Title: Broken Sternum misdiagnosed as a 'pulled muscle' at a GP Clinic in Taringa.

Story: I had an accident. I couldn't breathe properly and quickly left to drive home in severe pain. At home my mum took me straight to the dr at Taringa for a consult because I was in such pain I was crying and gasping for air - because each breathe felt like knife was ripping through my body. When I eventually saw the doctor after an hours' wait the doctor examined me and said it was merely a pulled muscle in my chest and to take panadol for a few days and it would go away. I requested an X-ray but the doctor said it wasn't needed. We went home, and for the next week I could not move, talk or breathe without a severe shooting pain ripping through my chest. Sleeping was agony and no matter what pain medication I took nothing helped. In the end my mum took me to another dr at Indooroopilly who on one look at me sent me straight for an x-Ray and confirmed I had broken my sternum (chest bone) completely in two. I was in a body cast for six weeks and in so much pain because it had moved around so much in the week prior to being re diagnosed. The original dr I saw would not send me for an X-ray and brushed off my symptoms as me overreacting. I will never go back there again.

Story: I had been complaining about pain in my right thigh for close on 6 months. One GP ordered an xray but nothing was found, then another GP ordered an ultrasound of the area around the right knee. The diagnosis was made, a meniscal tear. However I went to Cairns and my leg kept getting weaker and more painful. This continued until I fell against the kitchen bench and found that I could not move at all and was experiencing excruciating pain. Down to the Emergency Department of the Cairns Base Hospital I went and my leg was x-rayed. It was found to have two large cancerous lesions in my right thigh! ! ! ! Also the bone was rather thinned out and was a high risk of fracture. I was admitted to hospital, a titanium rod was inserted to reinforce the leg and treatment for multiple myeloma began. It took about five and half weeks before I was even remotely well enough to return home to Adelaide. Chemotherapy continues on down here. What I would like to know is how such a misdiagnosis was made? ? ? ? The xray company down here was at Noarlunga Hospital.

Story: After having a blood test as ordered by my doctor, I was contacted by the surgery who were concerned with the results. They asked me to go straight to Accident and Emergency and he would fax through my results. I was quite concerned about this and did as directed. I was taken straight into triage and placed on a heart monitor, had another blood test taken and then was cannulated, much to my surprise. I was then allocated a bed in Triage. The Triage staff were excellent, and even though they were flat out this day, they managed to find me some food and drink and check on my needs regularly. I was in there for well over 12 hours and had numerous bags of fluid administered before I was released. The doctors were very knowledgeable and very kind to me, keeping me informed of my condition, it's cause and what would be required in future treatment. It's not my first experience with Triage at Wyong, but I can resolutely say that every time I have had a family member in Triage the nurses and doctors have been nothing short of brilliant. They do a wonderful job.

Story: A doctor in Melbourne told me I had a pulled muscle and so had all sorts of therapy. Moved to Tasmania and went to local doctor who immediately sent me to xray who said gee you must be in a lot of pain. It seemed there was no cartilage at all at the weight bearing part and bone was wearing. Doctor put me on a list to see the surgeon re hip replacement. 1 year later I got an appointment to see the surgeon. But I think the surgeon was too busy to see me so got his apprentice to see me who seemed to be running back and forward to see the surgeon. Finally said I needed a hip replacement so go to booking office to fill in details. I asked then re waiting time and told it was 2 years. Given a brochure from Hobart hospital which stated that they treat the public patients (me) same as private patients. Just after 2 years got a questionnaire to see if still wanted surgery. Sent it back saying yes, then got a reply saying I had been taken off the list. So rang and found that the reply had "got lost in the mail". Put back on list apparently in same spot and told list had blown out to 2 years 8months. Then government bought in two more surgeons to get through the long term patients and I was offered a spot. But as I live on my own I need family to come from interstate to help out. So said it was inconvenient for them at time (only given 10 days notice) booking clerk said would call back in six weeks to book me in. Well that was eight weeks ago and still no sign. Spoke to local GP who said it was a waste of time calling but do it anyway. So I called with no joy and it was like getting blood out of a stone and would not tell me anything. So here I am still waiting. All I get is a 6 monthly follow up at physio which is a total waste of time. I believe I was put on the list as Cat 2 but it has never been reviewed and with the joint locking up and pain unbearable I believe that if checked I would be cat 1. I am disgusted with the lack of treatment, that I am getting no follow ups no reviews and it feels like just sit on the list and shut up is the attitude.

Story: I had a fall resulting in me falling approx 3. 5 metres landing on both feet, the result was 2 sprained ankles and severe fractures to the left calcaneus, I was placed in a half cast for 6 weeks where I was asked to make an appointment to see a doctor couple of months later at the consulting suites at Warragul hospital, one question I asked about was if doctor would need a follow-up X-ray to which I got the reply of not unless doctor has requested one. I arrived for my appointment where I was examined and the "OLD X-rays "(from initial fall) were used. Doctor advised the nurse to remove the cast and issued me with a certificate whereby I could return to work so no followup X-ray and no physical examination of my foot. I returned to work Monday and continued to do so till Wednesday were I got home and my foot was so sore I decided to see my own GP on the Thursday, I spent the first few minutes of the visit filling in details of my accident and explained how doctor had sent me back to work, my doctor's first question was to ask if there had been a followup X-ray to which I answered to his surprise "no" so this was his first request and he told me to stay off the foot till I saw him again the following Monday. He also asked me if there were any restrictions to my return to work such as reduced hours or light duties and again to his surprises I answered "no". I returned on the Monday with my X-ray and he found 2 large fractures that had not yet healed, so I was then back off work with no weight bearing on the foot again. I returned to work again a month later where I now do 2 days on 1 day off then 2 days on as the foot has still not 100% recovered and I find I still get pain if I try to do more than 2 days at a time or stand for more than a few minutes at a time. So to sum up, the things that bothered me the most was, 1: didn't bother with a follow up X-ray 2: No physical examination of my foot on the day and 3: sending me back to work too early even when I had told him that my job entailed me to be on my feet all day on concrete.

Title: From cyst to superbug - going into hospital shouldn't ever be considered trivial

Story: What I thought was simple day surgery turned into a nightmare when was infected with a 'super bug'. Top private hospital that always uses 'new' in surgery, yet ended up with two more visits into surgery, a PIC line pumping a baby bottle's worth of special antibiotics each day, and nearly three months off work leading to loss of employment. I knew I was in trouble when there were four nurses (two of them wound specialists) were standing behind me discussing bandaging options - 5 layers of different bandaging - and I heard the lead one say we're very worried about you. I don't think the hospital could have done anymore than it did, they took on board all treatment costs via their insurance and the daily nursing care was fantastic, but like all hospitals they prefer to keep quiet about having 'super bugs'. I have since learnt the mortality rate is up to 35% (ABS figures) and Australia has nearly 10, 000 reported cases a year - which would make this much higher and more deadly than the road toll - and its very expensive to treat with highly restricted AB drugs. So where's the Government action and priority? Why isn't the profile of the 'super bug' issue much higher? Do they need a mass mortality event to occur before this is seriously addressed?

During night around 11 PM, my cousin took me to The Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba. I understood there were few beds but reserved for ambulance emergencies. When I start vomiting I was put me on drip and asked what happened. I told them whole story. After 2-3 hours a physio came in and told me that I got rotator cuff. I was discharged with painkillers and recommended for physio. I asked for Xray and MRI. Triage nurse told me the waiting for Xray is 3 months and MRI is 6 months. She advised get it done privately. Next day I went to GP again and asked her to recommend me to some Neurologist. I got my MRI done from Wesley Hospital. It shows space in my cervical discs T3-T4 which resulted in tripping of nerves and hence pain in my neck and shoulder. I was totally shocked. I went to a neurologist in Brisbane. He appeared to me to be in a state of shock with Princess Alexandra's apparent diagnosis and MRI.

Author: the patient
Story: I was referred by GP for inspection of my larynx and had examination of my ears resulting in bleeding and deafness. The consultation was in Tasmania by an ENT specialist. I believe the request sent by my GP was for an inspection of my larynx only, as I had excessive mucus in my throat which was causing me problems when I had to talk for long periods of time. My ears were under the care of Hearing Australia and giving me no grief. They had been examined 2 days prior and declared OK with a minimum of wax. I had no idea what the intention was when the doctor asked me to climb up 2 or 3 steps onto a high platform used as a couch. The doctor looked into my ear and when began picking at the epithelium with alligator forceps I objected but seemingly the doctor would not desist and I was crying and begging to be allowed to get off the table. I suggested I put oil into my ears to soften the wax which the doctor claimed was there. This was denied. I know I became very confused as the doctor did not appear to take any notice of my pleas. The doctor then applied a suction device to the drum and caused excruciating pain. The table was so high I could not get off. Both ears were bleeding when I left and inspected by both my GP and Hearing Australia who I believe both reported clots over the right drum and blood in the Left canal. I sent a report to the Ombudsman's office and have a huge folder of back and forth ever since with the final communication from the Tasmanian Medical Board telling me the matter is closed. It would also seem that they had also advised that what the ENT specialist did was for my benefit! It appeared to me that they tried to blame my GP for not telling the specialist that I was on a particular prescription but I don't believe that there was any need to do so, for an inspection of my larynx. I was informed that "independent expert opinion confirms the Dr's management was appropriate and in keeping with expected professional standards for an Otolaryngologist in the circumstances". They would not let me see these deliberations nor inform me of the extra costs that this unnecessary procedure attracted, when I asked for these. I now have considerable deafness which is unrelieved by the most sophisticated hearing aids and I am disadvantaged, socially, professionally and financially.

Story: My husband was taken by ambulance in enormous pain and had to go the QEH as it was the closest to where we lived. He had a kidney stone. The nurses seemed to be unable to get any blood from him which I think resulted in his arm being extremely bruised. He was in so much pain they gave him a suppository but told him to insert it himself in an open environment where other patients were also being attended to. He was left in a bed and no one came to see him from that point on. I felt it was truly like a third world country hospital with, what I would consider, third world doctors and nurses. He was sent home 7.00am the next morning. Nurses and doctor rating for that visit -10/10. There were people in beds in the waiting room with drips on, there was a young lad in a bed near the automatic doors which kept on opening and shutting. Staff appeared to not want to talk to anyone. I felt it was an absolutely disgusting place to have to go to. By 4.00pm that afternoon I took him to Royal Adelaide. They took him straight in, did x-rays, explained about the kidney stone and gave him medication to control the pain. Nurses and doctor rating for that visit 10/10. Keep up the good work RAH.

Author: the patient
Story: At our 19 week scan it was discovered that the placenta was not working as it should, our baby had stopped growing and would die in utero, so following an amniocentesis we made the decision to be induced at 21+4 weeks. We had two doctors talk to us; one left a little bit to be desired re: his bedside manner, but the other was brilliant and compassionate in spite of his incredibly busy schedule. The midwives were absolutely brilliant. I am so grateful for their compassion and care. We had a scheduled induced labour where I was allowed morphine and gas and had both my partner and mum with me for support. Our son was stillborn and following delivery we were allowed to hold him for as long as we liked and was then taken to our room for the night. The midwives very kindly located allocated us a room at the end of the ward as far from the babies as possible to try to minimise our exposure to newborn cries and allowed both my partner and my mother to stay overnight for support with me which made such a difference. After my discharge the next day, we were permitted and encouraged to come to the hospital and spend time saying goodbye to our son as much as we liked until he was transported to the perinatal pathologists two days later. On one of these occasions one of the midwives asked to sit with me and meet him and she sat with me, hugged me and cried with me. I cannot express my gratitude to the midwives enough. The only real negative experience I had with the hospital was with the admin. Admin and birth registration papers were not in stock when we left so we were forced multiple times to return to the hospital to collect papers in the weeks following, which was a bit unnerving. In addition, about a week or so after the birth, I had a phone call from a doctor asking how your pregnancy is coming along as we have not seen you in a little while? After recounting to him the situation, he said oh my god, I'm so sorry... I should have read your file before I called. In my shock, I stupidly did not confirm his name so I can't be 100% sure which doctor it was (and the hospital conveniently has no record of the phone call) however I am fairly sure I have an idea and as we are currently expecting again and have had another poor experience with his not reading files and his poor bedside manner, I have requested a note be out on my file that I not be seen by that particular doctor anymore. That doctor's behaviour however has definitely been the exception... All in all we have received fantastic care at RPA, particularly by the midwives. Compassionate, genuine, caring and attentive. They managed to make an awful event somewhat bearable for which I will be ever grateful.

I should know bit of my condition but twice I got a very young doctor and was told I was only a layman and did not know what I talking about and they were the doctors and knew everything and could not understand why I got upset and especially I was told by 3 doctors before how I should have been treated but now at least I have a letter from a specialist to present to the doctors on how I should be treated. But once you get past the emergency department the treatment is very good and have no reason to complain all my tests are all done in private hospital but does not have emergency department so have to go trough the public system before I get into private

Title: Dying father's care questionable at Flinders Medical Centre.
Time: 2013-10-26T03:31:31Z
Location: Flinders Medical Centre;
Author: a relative
Story: My father was admitted to Flinders Medical Centre. When I arrived he was on a trolley in the corridor in the emergency department unattended. After hunting a staff member down I was told he had had a stroke, couldn't speak and had right sided weakness. Knowing that a stroke is time critical I asked about treatment and understood that as nobody was with him when he was found it was probably too late. Although it seemed that my family's knowledge of my father was ignored when it came to assessing the time of stroke given the circumstances in which he was found. This made me feel a little uncomfortable. We waited in the emergency department until a bed became available, during which time I had to ask about pain relief as my father was frowning and rubbing his head. Twice I had to inform both nursing and medical staff that oral panadol wasn't an appropriate medication given that he couldn't speak and in all probability had trouble swallowing as well. This made me feel more than a little uncomfortable. My father became increasingly agitated, which has been a frequent pattern in his previous hospital admissions. The ward to which he was admitted was a specialized stroke unit. On this ward he was shackled as he tried to get out of bed. My father is hearing impaired which made the situation more difficult. This meant that between my sister and I we spent shifts at the hospital as if a family member was there it meant that he did not have to be shackled which made him even more agitated and quite frankly I suspect frightened. He also had a naso-gastric tube for feeding as I believed his swallowing reflexes were not strong enough and he was at risk of aspiration. One morning my sister arrived on ward to find the bed flat and him positioned head down which she thought was to prevent him from trying to get out even though he was shackled. He developed aspiration pneumonia and had to be treated with antibiotics. I had a meeting with the nurse in charge of the ward to be 'reassured' that yes that probably wasn't appropriate and that it wouldn't happen again. I also brought up the fact that nurses I saw were constantly complaining about being busy and that as a visitor that spent most of the day there, I had almost felt like I should be getting paid for things like rescuing wandering patients as they took off out the door and I felt were at risk of falling and ringing bells for patients that were crying out. I found this rather traumatic. My father was eventually specialed after what we thought was considerable agitating by my sister and myself. For this we were grateful. Although there was another incident where a nurse tried to give oral medication even though it was documented that my father was nil orally. The road to recovery was particularly rocky. The physio's I saw on the ward were particularly wonderful. They offered encouragement and compassion. The speech therapist's we saw seemed to be always busy but also were encouraging, but we believed missed some days because of their workload. This we found distressful because my father's ability to swallow was particularly important. Every day there seemed to be a battle with care. When telling nursing staff attending my father that he was in a wet bed to be seemingly told that they were busy writing notes and would be there when they were finished I found particularity distressing and wondered how they prioritized or rather who was responsible for teaching them how to prioritize. My father was moved into a side room as he had developed a bowel infection. After 3 days of being in bed he was being sat out of bed and going for small walks. I asked the two nurses who were looking after him one morning if he might have a shower on the shower chair instead of a wash. I received what I thought was a grunt and she appeared to rolled her eyes in disapproval. I thought it was not an unreasonable request, especially as the day before he had had a shower without incident. My father was stripped naked, put on a shower chair and sat over the toilet before having a shower while they proceed to make his bed and I thought, chat about what they had bought at the local shopping centre the day before. I will never forget the look on my father's face as he tried to hide his genitals and tried not to shiver - it was pitiful. It had to be pointed out that I think perhaps that this wasn't good nursing care as I found a blanket to put around my father. His temperature which was recorded after this incident was 35 On so many different levels to me this was plainly wrong. A decision had to be made whether to put a PEG in to feed him or palliate. Both my sister and I felt we were being rushed into this decision. We felt pressured because we were told that he had been in the ward for some time. Which we took as code for 'he's taking up a bed". The social worker became involved and she was wonderful as we told her our story. It seemed we almost had to go into battle with the medical staff dealing with my father to keep him alive. When discussing the idea of a PEG with the doctor on the ward he told us that he might not survive the anaesthetic. Both my sister and I felt comfortable with this and decided that he was not not for resuscitation. Our understanding was that this would require a lot of paper work if it did come to that and would be a coroners case. I was flabbergasted with this response, especially as this conversation took place in a four bed ward in front of my father and the other people in the ward. It was my father's wishes that he be given every chance of survival if sometime he was in a situation where something could be done. Knowing this was how he felt as a family we felt that his wishes had to be honored. I spoke to my father regarding treatment. Told him that it was important that the naso-gastric stayed in until it could be replaced by something more permanent because his swallowing wasn't strong enough just yet to enable him to have enough intake to sustain him. Unsure about how much of this he understood I asked him to nod his head if he understood and he nodded his head. My father was cognisant of what was going on. I felt he recognized and smiled when we entered the room. My father's naso-gastric tube 'fell out' we believe one afternoon as he was being transferred back to bed. The exact circumstances were a little unclear. At the same time we felt pressured into making a decision to palliate or PEG. We were told he would be a nursing home candidate with little quality of life. We were also told he would not walk..... but had been doing laps around the ward with the physio's.....so understandably it was a difficult decision with medical input not being the only consideration to be taken into account. We were offered the opportunity to speak to a palliative care physician which we were grateful for. Although he just seemed to reinforce the idea that my father's quality of life was what mattered not quantity. Which was a bit of a no brainer really. We were contacted by the social worker to be told that we should be prepared to expect a request for a definitive answer in the family meeting which was arranged for that morning. I will forever be grateful to the social worker for her support and for her advocacy on our behalf. In the family meeting I felt as if I had to justify my father's existence and plead for his life really even though I knew ultimately the family has the final say. Even so, if we decided to PEG my father as soon as this was done we would be discharged into the first nursing home vacancy and there are some nursing homes we feel leave a lot to be desired and this was something which we as a family feared. Again, there was the overwhelming feeling that my father had occupied a bed for far too long and the hospital needed a bed. Which is something which I can understand on one level. The decision was made to palliate. Not withdrawal of treatment but rather comfort care. All medication was withdrawn. Fluids were withdrawn. Oxygen and nebulizers were withdrawn. Anything he could tolerate orally was allowed. Pain relief was written up. This was decided on a friday and it was our understanding to hold off on anything oral until the speech therapist had come to do a further assessment, which we thought was meant to happen that afternoon. Needless to say nobody showed up and when we finally asked for them to be paged we were told that everybody had gone home and there would be somebody in the next day. So much for comfort care. The next morning my father was semi conscious, prior to that to us he had seemed to be awake and alert. It appears that he had been written up for 5mg of morphine SC, and even though he did not appear to have obvious pain he was given this to settle as he was again trying to get out of bed. My immediate thoughts were if I had not had anything to drink for over 24 hours I too might be wanting to get out of bed to get a drink. It became obvious to me that he had been over sedated to the point of unconsciousness, this was particularly distressing as my brother was returning from overseas and we were hoping that my father would be awake enough to both recognize and spend time with him before he died. Hours later it appeared my father was rousable and wake enough to recognize my sister and myself. We fed him some pureed apples which he not only seemed to enjoyed but beckoned for more. Hours later the nurse looking after him stood at the end of his bed and inquired if we thought he was hungry, the empty pureed apple pot was produced as proof that he was, as he had consumed the entire pot and had managed to swallow it without incident. Later the nurse in charge of the shift appeared with a piece of paper for me to sign saying that I took responsibility for my actions. I also received what I thought was a lecture on what might happened, i.e aspiration and death. Two people in the ward remarked that they thought the nurse had been rude and that they were shocked by her behavior. On her second attempt to get me to sign a form I asked her to step into the corridor to discuss this as I felt it was not appropriate in the middle of a ward. There I had to explain to her that comfort care meant just that. If comfort care was to be commenced it was to commenced in its entirety. If my father had to wait for 3 days to be given the go ahead for oral comfort care then all medications, fluids, and oxygen were to recommenced until the speech therapist could come and he could be afforded the proper comfort care which he was entitled to receive. And if this wasn't the case I believed she had failed in her duty of care towards my father and presumably others who had gone before him and those who would come after him. When this was eventually sorted out my father was moved into a side room to wait for death. Some staff members were wonderful bringing in CD player and CD's and dropping in to see how things were going. Luckily the palliative care physician paid a visit so we could sort out more appropriate medications. All my fathers medications were withdrawn and as a result he suffered lots burping which usually indicated that he was suffering from reflux and epigastric pain. It was just all to hard to agitate for something else again for my father. I informed the nursing staff but I felt it got me nowhere. So I gave him his nexium for a few days until the burping subsided. I don't believe I should have had to do this. I did it because I thought it relieved my fathers suffering. My father died from respiratory failure.

Story: I have nothing but praise for these two departments. The care and consideration that I received before and after my two cancer operations has been nothing but exceptional. The operations and the follow up treatment and monitoring that I am receiving now couldn't be better. I believe that the PAH is the best hospital in Australia. I had one kidney removed because of cancer then years later I had my prostate removed also because of cancer. Also I had my gall bladder removed. This operation and after care treatment and professionalism was also the best. I also had a operation performed last year and only waited six months for this operation. Some people might complain that this was an excessive time to wait and maybe in some circumstances it would be but I was quite content with the time frame and with the outcome. My one kidney is functioning well without it's mate. My prostate is no longer there but my PSA is rising but the Princess Alexandra Hospital is monitoring my progress. The one criticism that I do have, not with any of the above departments but still with the PAH was that I was diagnosed with a tumour which I still have today. It took me a number of years to see a specialist in the Oncology Department.

Title: Hospital administers anti psychotic drugs ignoring patient's wishes.
Time: 2013-10-26T04:13:26Z
Location: Bendigo Hospital;
Author: the patient
Story: I attended Bendigo Hospital Emergency department around two weeks after being flashed in the eye with a halogen search light. I had not been able to get an appointment at the Bendigo Eye Clinic and in desperation and a 14 day long debilitating migraine, I decided to wait in the emergency department, hoping for a confirmation diagnosis and a referral of the damage to my left eye. After waiting four hours (I had expected to wait some time as I knew there would be other more serious cases that would be triaged before me). I finally saw the doctor. I explained that I had been flashed in the eye with a halogen search light two weeks ago and had not been able to get an appointment at Bendigo Eye Clinic and that subsequently I had been suffering from a severe migraine for the last two weeks, with flashing lights, loss of vision, photo phobia, nausea etc. I also explained that I did not want drugs, as that in my experience, they did little to reduce the symptoms of migraine and I really required a referral for tests/treatment and confirmation that the retina of my left eye had been burnt/ damaged by the halogen flash. I even "joked" with the nurse, when she said that we don't give Pethadine or morphine out any more for migraines as all the drug addicts used to come in with migraines just for the drugs! ! I told her that that was ok as I was NOT here for drugs and reiterated I wished for a diagnosis/ referral. I understood the doctor ordered sample/s of my blood be taken for tests as well as a blood glucose test for diabetes. The nurse stated that I was a bit dehydrated and that she would set up a bag of saline and take the blood samples required from the IV jack instead of pin cushioning me. After the bloods were taken and the IV set up, I was wheeled into a dark room to wait. After what seemed forever (really 2 hours) I looked at the time and realised I had been in emergency for six hours now and my children were at home alone waiting for me..........and "what was taking so long? " I buzzed for the nurse and as I waited for her, I noticed that my date of birth on my admissions bracelet was incorrect. The nurse arrived and it wasn't until I tried to talk to her that I noticed that my speech was slurred and incoherent. I then assumed that the IV that they had set up, must have also contained the anti psychotic drug that they had recommended earlier, that I had REFUSED! ! I was very upset at the fact it seemed that they had "medicated" me against my wishes and insisted that they take the IV out of my arm, or that I would "pull it out myself". I was having a great deal of trouble speaking due to the medication and sounded like a drunk or someone with a severe brain injury. I also managed to tell the nurse that my date of birth was incorrect on my admissions bracelet, which she agreed was a serious oversight and that she would rectify. The nurse insisted that I see the doctor, before removing the IV and anti psychotics from my arm. Around 15 minutes later, I could hear the doctor outside the cubical that I had been placed in, insisting to the (I assume) nurses, that I be made aware that I was signing myself out against the doctors wishes. Shortly after, the doctor came in to remove the IV. He appeared to me to be very rude and obviously annoyed at me, ripping the IV out with what seemed little care, then storming out of the cubicle. I was gob smacked, dumbfounded and very confused, I could barely stand up and my balance was very shaky. I steadied myself with my hands on the walls and proceeded to leave the cubicle, where the doctor had left me. I was literally bouncing like a "pin ball" from wall to wall, desperately trying to find my way out of the hospital. I was very upset, confused and becoming very anxious. In desperation, I walked into an office and tried to ask the women at her desk, how to get out of the hospital. She explained and I managed to find my way to the entrance of the emergency department. I managed to phone a friend to pick me up, but as there was no duty of care, I could well have got in my car and tried to drive or walked out onto the road and under a bus/car. PS I am not a recovering "drug addict" but later thought that if I had been, that giving me those anti psychotics against my will, may have been even more serious than the effects caused to me. A few weeks later when I finally managed to get an appointment at the Bendigo Eye Clinic, I informed the doctor there that they had taken blood for testing at Bendigo Hospital and perhaps they could get the outcome of those tests. I could hear the nurse as she called Bendigo Hospital for the results and her repeating my name, address and date of birth, when I remembered that my admissions bracelet at Bendigo Hospital emergency had my date of birth incorrectly recorded and that the nurse had said she would rectify this. Clearly, it seems, she did not. I explained to the nurse at the Bendigo Eye Clinic, what had occurred with my date of birth on my admissions bracelet..........she was then able to access my test results.

Story: I got the virus/cold going around. I went to ER with pneumonia and collapsed lung. The visitor to the patient in the bed next to me was coughing that hacking cough. I said you need to go doctor and get antibiotics and please do not come back to the hospital before you are well again. The visitor seemed to get angry and said I am OK and the antibiotics will work for me and I'll not be sick more than a few days. Yeah maybe I said but you are infecting all the nurses and doctors, patients and other visitors. I didn't want my family to visit me as they would have caught that virus/cold again (most had just recovered from it). It seemed to me that one nurse wanted her sent home but one of the doctors said no one could enforce her to leave the hospital and not return until she was well and not that hacking cough. The hospital will not answer my letter regarding putting a stop to this just telling me it is up to the visitor whether they come to the hospital sick and infecting everyone else! Not right and needs change. Can someone tell me who has authority to turn sick visitors to a hospital away?

However, this did not seem to reduce the efforts made by three surgical teams through the night to piece him back together; all the time keeping us informed as to the progress. I think that it was through their relentless efforts, my foster son survived. Sure, he'll never be quite the same but he can walk, earn a living for his wife and children and manages to overcome the pain and discomfort that will, I think, no doubt, be with him for the rest of his life.

Story: My husband had been suffering from tonsillitis for about 12 months, he would get a sore throat then be in hospital by the end of the day with 40+ temp and fitting! He had been hospitalized 5 times last year and 3 times this year, then they said this is not assisting his life so they put him on a waiting list for a tonsillectomy. We waited approx 8 weeks for a date to have the surgery, the nurses and staff were excellent, the care and concern they showed my husband was terrific. After discharge he was still sore and not well so he rested for a few days and then he got very ill, straight back to the Casey ED and they had him admitted and on a ward within 4 hours with IV antibiotics. They have been fabulous as well with my mother's cancer treatment. They have been so accommodating as she has anaphyliaxis (severe allergies) they put her in her own room as to not be at risk of other patients' deodorants, perfumes, flowers etc, I cooked her meals and these were taken to her, not one complaint or explanation on why they couldn't do it for her as previous hospitals she has been a patient in! The Casey ED had been wonderful.

Title: Lack of appropriate care for my 94 year old father.
Time: 2013-10-26T10:56:18Z
Location: Gosford Hospital;Wyong Public Hospital;Berkley Vale Private Hospital / Rehabilitation;
Author: a relative
Story: My 94 year old father had a very bad headache in November last year and was taken to Wyong Hospital by ambulance. He was admitted and was then it seemed, confined to bed. Prior to this he was living independently by himself in his own home. Confining him to bed appeared to weakened his leg muscles very rapidly. In addition to this, the staff attending my father seem to decide it was easier to put him in incontinence pants rather than take him to the toilet. Our family objected strongly to this treatment and it was then, we believe, decided that he be rehabilitated and allowed to start walking with assistance so he could go to the toilet. He was also taking long walks around the ward. We then gathered it was decided by doctors attending my father, that he should be fitted with a Pacemaker. He was transferred to Gosford Private hospital for this to happen. After the surgery it seemed to me that he was basically left in bed again until my family started to get him up and walk around the wards again. It is now early December and Medical staff involved with my father decide (and we agreed) that Dad should be transferred to Berkely Vale Rehab Hospital to get his strength back. On his second day there, he appeared to take a turn and lost consciousness for a while. He was taken for brain scans and we believe these came back essentially clear. Dad regained consciousness and seemed to regain his senses but could not get out of bed again. At about this time he came under the care of one particular doctor. I was visiting Dad every day and it appeared that suddenly he was sleeping all the time. The times that he was awake we believe his vision seemed to be suffering. Dad only had vision in one eye and was on drops to keep his other eye good. The only reason I can see why his vision would be suffering was that he may not be receiving this medication. OK... So now my father, who is a bit deaf, can now it seems only see a little bit out of one eye, is constantly being called by his first name despite not being known by that name since he was a little child, is put on a drug called Seroquel, allegedly because he is violent. I say he is not violent, he is terrified because people suddenly appear and grab his arm to move him and he can't see or hear them. We believe that it has been on his file since day one that he had only one eye and was partially deaf and also that he was known by his other Christian name not the first one. On his file all that time and yet, it would appear that every time he goes to a new hospital, when we mention these details to staff attending my father it seems to come as a complete surprise to them, as was the reason he was admitted to hospital in the first place. Nobody appears to read records! Now, we believe, he is constantly being sedated with Seroquel and Berkely Vale seemingly decide that he should move to high care facilities so they arrange a transfer to Gosford District Hospital. It is now mid December and there it appears there is no bed available in the Geriatric section so he is being transferred to the Respiratory Care unit until a bed is available. My family and I get into the ear of the Doctor in charge of the unit here and ask that he be taken off all sedative medication. The doctor agrees and my father begins, it appears, to regain his alertness and humor. After a few days he is transferred to Geriatrics and the doctor who treated my father earlier gets involved again and it seems he is put back onto Seroquel. I only needed to do a small amount of research into this drug to read it should not be given to elderly people and especially those with Dementia. It would appear to have many side effects, some of which my father seemed to be suffering, and worst of all the research I saw reported it was proven to increase mortality by 1. 6 - 1. 7 times. When I raised these concerns with staff attending my father (I was never able to talk to the doctor directly) I felt I was dismissed as uninformed. I raised them with one particular nurse, who seemed to share my concerns after viewing the research. When the nurse raised this with the doctor's staff, the nurse came back, apparently, very sheepishly and apologetically saying there was nothing the nurse could do. I believe the nurseâ€™s career was threatened. My father was in Gosford getting, I believe, progressively worse and staff attending my father at Gosford were, we felt, putting pressure on us as a family to get him in to an aged care facility. On around the 10th of February we got him into Bethsham at Wyee. A week after he was dead.

He admitted me, two days later an angiogram was done, I had a 90% blockage of the main heart artery and 40% blockage of other arteries. Exactly one week before angiogram a senior cardiologist at the Alfred wrote to my GP telling him that my chest pain was NOT heart related! My warning is to everyone DON'T listen to what one doctor says, GET another opinion ALWAYS doesn't matter how good the hospital is.

Author: the patient
Story: I presented to Wyong public hospital. I had been thrown from a horse and was suffering from severe hip and leg pain. Visual disturbances. I was placed in a wheelchair and asked the usual admission questions. When asked my name I could not answer and I did not know my address. I was able to present my license which had the information listed. I knew where I was and why but in my opinion was suffering an obvious concussion. I was assessed by the doctor who I advised I had a sore hip, sore neck and sore wrist. There was skin of my hands shoulder and knee. My knee being the worst with actual cuts along with the grazes. I was given oral pain medication and taken for an x-ray or my hip only. I waited in bed for the results. I had on several occasions told the nurses my hand really hurt. Pointing to the area where the thumb meets the wrist. When the doctor finally came to check me he felt over the grazes with his fingers and palpated for approx 10 seconds and said they were OK. I was in a lot of pain. I couldn't move. It was extremely painful to walk due to the concussion my hip took when I hit the ground and my neck really hurt as well. All of which I relayed to the doctor. I had no peripheral vision. Doctors or nurses would approach the bed and when they spoke I would near jump out of my skin as I didn't see them there. (I was laying straight on my back sat slightly upright) my vision was so poorly I could not see my mobile phone to write a text. It was all blurry. Not too long after my husband arrived I was told my hip x-ray was clear and I was being discharged. However they were organizing crutches. I told the man (nurse/orderly I'm unsure) that my hand was far too sore I couldn't possibly walk on them. I felt they pressured me into doing so and when I bore weight, for the brief moment I did, it was excruciating. So they gave me a wheelchair. I was given Panadeine Forte prescription and sent home. After 4 days at home in agony I presented to my doctor and obtained an x-ray of my left wrist which showed a clear and easily visible fracture of the scaphoid. I noted that on my discharge report it did not list any suggestion of concussion. Not one of my wounds was cleaned. I was in plaster for 6 weeks and I am now 10months later able to bear weight on it again. At times it aches and there is a pulsating feeling down my thumb. My knee scarred and I still suffer from neck pain. The doctors on arrival saw my injuries, heard my story and expressions of pain and I feel because it was new years eve got rid of me. I didn't think it was busy. And I know this as I have been there before (looked after by Bronwyn in the ED, that lady is amazing) It is very disconcerting when you are injured so severely (my helmet inside shattered) you don't know your name, can't see properly, are in extreme discomfort unable to walk and you are sent home with pain killers without effective treatment. I now have scars, ongoing associated pain in my wrist which I felt I was forced to bear weight on and a remaining haematoma in my right buttock. They never checked my back at all. I have a history of thrombocytosis which is on my file. Overall I am extremely unimpressed with the doctors there. If it was a busy day perhaps but it was the quietest I had seen the place. I hope they all had a happy new year. Mine was spent in agony on Panadeine Forte nursing an untreated bone fracture. The whole experience also had a psychological impact. Not fun at all.

Title: I can't speak highly enough of the neurosurgeons at Royal Hobart Hospital that treated me but can't say the same for the neurologist ...

Story: I'd been suffering headaches for 2 years, finally got diagnosed with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension in September 2012. My neurologist at the Royal Hobart Hospital that has been treating me with different medications, regular lumbar punctures and also having correspondence with my ophthalmologist and GP who I felt kept treating me like I was faking my illness and seemed to be very dismissive about anything I had to say even though the test results said something different. After speaking with my ophthalmologist and realising I was loosing too much vision, too quickly they finally decided to refer me on to a Neurosurgeon for a VP Shunt. Within 10 minutes of my first consultation with the surgeons they looked at MRI's that were over a year old and through all correspondence with my ophthalmologist they realised I had have Chiari Malformation type 1 (another brain disease that is easily picked up via MRI and listening to my symptoms). Then the question which nobody will answer for me is "Why the heck didn't my neurologist pick up on this a year ago when he went through all my scans etc." I got very lucky the day I went for another MRI to make sure it hadn't developed into type 2 and see which surgery I needed to have first the VP Shunt or the Decompression surgery. I can't speak highly enough of the neurosurgeons that treated me but as for the neurologist I'd love to know how many other people he has ignored and glanced over made them feel small and insignificant like he done to me.

Story: I had severe pain in upper abdominal area. Presented myself to Emergency Dept. only after a suggestion from a Nurse on Health Direct (I was extremely impressed with the service I received and the concern that she expressed whilst speaking with me). The Nurse at Flinders Medical Centre took details, asking me if I still had my gall bladder. The Nurse was then, what I thought, rudely interrupted by an Emergency Dr who did not appear to look at notes that had been taken and asked me to explain all over again. Sent home 2hrs later being diagnosed as having Constipation. Was left to get a prescription from Chemist and some Pain Killers. Had tried to get into GP before I presented myself to Hospital but had to wait 3days. Went to GP and 5days later was in Hospital having my Gall Bladder removed which was extremely inflamed and a very large thickening on the wall. I felt that just because I have Grey Hair and am elderly some think I am are just silly and have Constipation! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

Author: a carer
Story: After spending some time in a country hospital my friend was detained under the Mental Health Act ( long term mental illness) as the hospital did not have the facilities to monitor her. She was flown to The Royal Adelaide Hospital and sent to the emergency department. My understanding is that there she was left. It appeared that her medication regime was altered after a quick visit from a doctor two days later. I am led to believe that she was given no medication for two days. By the Sunday she wanted to go home. She cannot recall being given meals nor whether she was allowed to shower. I understand she was assigned a security guard and sedated and was very distressed which exacerbated her illness. When I went to visit her on the Monday she was still where they left her. When I inquired as to her whereabouts to visit, a young nurse at the counter said to another staff member " she's the one that goes off" (I am sure anyone would have in the same situation) and then I found her in the Emergency Dept.on a gurney still. A nurse approached me and said that every day they have a bed meeting and patients are allocated beds. The Royal Adelaide Hospital had had a bed vacant in their mental health unit the whole time but, my understanding is that due to politics it was being held in case a patient came in from the metropolitan area. My friend was from the country you see. The place for them was rural and remote at Glenside but no beds were vacant there. This one kind nurse said that they argued at these meetings that the bed be given to my friend and she said to me that the staff were not allowed to say anything but I should to the media. I never did but wish I had. I feel she has never been the same since and it is our biggest fear that this might happen again now that she is on Clozapine, a medication that can have life threatening side effects if not administered and monitored correctly.

Story: I have been a day patient at the Greenslopes Private Hospital (Veterans' Clinic) on many occasions. While being accessed for surgery of BCC's or SCC's no biopsies were ordered by the doctors unless requested by me. In my opinion, I have had disfiguring operation done on my face after visual examinations and the post pathology reports have returned a negative result. These results are contained in my file. I have had surgical registrars comment to me "why did they perform this surgery" My response has been "I don't know, I thought they would have ordered biopsy's before operating. " I have a theory that the Veterans Skin Cancer Clinic is being abused by visiting specialists and taking advantage of the casual attitude of the consenting ex-service personnel.

Story: Went to emergency at Frankston hospital on a Sunday night, nursing staff were good, but I thought I received horribly poor treatment from a Dr post xrays asking my 3 yr old son to walk on his suspected broken ankle before checking the xrays. Sent home told no fracture, keep up Panadol and Nuerophen. Phone call late Monday from Dr saying missed fracture last night, come back in, you'll be escalated through emergency, we'll plaster and xray again. 4+ hours waiting waiting waiting. Suspect smell from plaster, went back in pressure sores and ulcer under plaster, re-plastered and sent home, as far as I could tell there were no antibiotics for infection. Went next day to have ulcer dressed, hole cut in plaster to dress wound, to me it appeared severely infected but again it did not seem to me to be any antibiotics or swabs taken. After not liking how it looked went to GP, infected swabbed and tested positive staph infection, two courses of antibiotics and having to have infected wound dressed daily. Refused to go back to Frankston and even if I wanted to couldn't get an appointment. Plaster was due to come off week 6, couldn't get an appointment so had to go elsewhere. In my opinion, poor service in every encounter, only received follow up of complaint 7 weeks after incident.

Author: the patient
Story: I had a posterior vaginal repair. Nine days after surgery I had a smelly vaginal discharge that looked infected. I called the surgeon's rooms and spoke to a midwife. A prescription for a single antibiotic was faxed to my local pharmacy! The surgeon did not speak to me, my wound was not examined and no swab was taken for Microscopy, Culture and Sensitivity. I took the antibiotic. Twelve days after completing the course I was diagnosed with a wound abscess. This was not incised and drained, it was treated with a different antibiotic and paste. I can assure you that it is not a good idea to put this paste anywhere near your vagina! Luckily for me, when this abscess ruptured it ruptured vaginally and not rectally, so I did not develop a fistula. All this infection and scarring has left me with a short, narrow, painful vagina and has completely destroyed my previously very pleasant sex life. I am appalled that a surgeon blindly prescribe a patient a single antibiotic by Fax for a post-operative wound infection that wasn't even examined or swabbed.

Title: A very unpleasant experience at Port Macquarie Hospital.

Author: the patient
Story: I extended my lower back which went into extreme spasms, and dropped to my knees. Some 3 hrs later, I was taken to Port Macquarie hospital by ambulance, to emergency section. I was given many doses of morphine due to extreme pain, and admitted to a cubicle. I was seen by a nurse, who seemed in an aggressive, disinterested mood, and this was to be my day of hell. After being examined by her, I was left alone for a long time, and upon her return, I asked for a urine bottle, to which I was told to "walk to the toilet". I explained I had tried repeatedly to walk but was unable to due to the pain, and the lack of use of my legs. No bottle was supplied. I repeated this request again some 2 hours later, again was refused. I also had been admitted prior to the lunch serving, informed the nurse when questioned about the morning actions, and told her I had eaten nothing prior coming to Hospital, under 000 phone advice. Again, I was refused food, again I urgently requested a wee bottle, again it was refused with the instruction to walk to the toilet. This nurse was apparently to take leave at the end of this day, and I guess I meant it would not be an early finish. At approx. 8.00pm, I was assisted out of the emergency cubicle, lifted to the toilet area, and relieved myself, after being refused the bottle 4 times. I was then driven home by a mate, and had to stay in bed for 3 days, unable to walk unassisted. I later wrote to the Hospital, the Director of Nursing investigated the complaint, told me he didn't believe the Nurses account, and said he would improve procedures in receiving persons with conditions such as mine. I believe the matter was just dispensed with, and was told an entry would be made on the nurses personnel file. What a relief, she can do the same thing 3 times, before she can be punished or dismissed. That day sits firmly in my mind, as awful treatment which would be unacceptable to an animal, let alone a person. Disciplinary action should have been the minimum. Luckily, I have had only 3 occasions in my life to enter hospital, the other two were in different hospitals, as was the treatment. They were professional and dedicated in their duties. I think the nurse nominated should have been dismissed, after investigation. That's my story, a very unpleasant experience in a NSW Hospital.

Title: I felt like a third grade citizen at Monash Medical Centre

Location: Monash Medical Centre;
Author: the patient
Story: I was admitted to Monash Medical Center, for a minor drug overdose, to which was not my own doing, but rather an accident [I will let people make up their own minds up. Otherwise I couldn't care less what people think]. Also I'm not a drug user, by any stretch of the imagination. Since this was a first time to experience this unfortunate event, to which I'm still not proud of, I thought I would admit myself at Monash. However that night, I felt I was treated not like a patient. Instead I felt I was treated like a third grade citizen, an animal, and a d****ead [to put it mildly]. Despite me not knowing the effects the drugs had over me, I felt I was still in control of most of the things I was saying. I felt, the nurses did nothing for me to comfort me or encourage me to be strong. It appeared to me that the nurses thought the drugs had taken it's full effect, and performed, what seem to me to be, stupid/idiotic tests on me, bringing me around from room to room, and putting shit [otherwise known as instruments and tools] in my mouth and eye. I felt let down, feeling humiliated, and embarrassed. I absolutely hated and felt disgusted the way I was being treated that night. I was born at Monash, I had major surgery there when I was a teenager, a family member was admitted there during their cancer to which this family member is now passed away, and many other times I went to the Monash. I had an excellent experience, the people were fantastic, and supportive. I understand maybe I'm a little to blame, and the situation might not have been so severe, but this is not the point. The point I'm trying to make is that nurses and health professionals, have a duty of "unlimited sympathetic care" to their patients in any situation. Whether it's a scratch on your knee, a major surgery, or a drug overdose, I think nurses and health professionals need to exercise a sense of sensitivity towards all patients, in any situation. Unfortunately I did not feel this from them that night. I do not want people thinking, this is a reflection of the entire health system, because I commend the hard work nurses and health professionals perform to all Australians, I really do, with hand on heart. I also wish them to continue to fight for their entitlements, to support their hard work, and commitment to public service. However this latest experience, has forced me to turn my back on the Monash Medical Center, and I have made a commitment to myself to never go back there again.

Title: Box Hill Hospital confusion with elderly mother
Time: 2013-10-28T08:19:57Z
Location: Epworth Eastern Hospital;Box Hill Hospital / Accident & emergency;
Author: a relative
Story: My Box Hill Hospital Story My 88 year old mother fell on a footpath while on her daily walk. She injured her knees, and severely injured her elbow. Someone called an ambulance, and she was taken to casualty at Box Hill Hospital. The ambulance crew called me, (assuring me that the elbow was not broken) and I went straight to the casualty department, where my mother was sitting on a chair in the waiting room. As I walked in, she seemed to have â€˜faintedâ€™ and was laid on the floor until a stretcher was put under her and she was taken to a room in the casualty department. She didn't appear to have been given any pain relief. She was taken to x-ray, and then admitted. I was told that her elbow required surgery, and that it would be done that evening. I asked for her to be transferred to Epworth Private over the road, because she was adequately covered by her health insurance fund. I was assured that there was no need, as she would have surgery that evening. She had been fasted in anticipation of surgery. It did not happen that night. Nor the next, nor the next. Each day she was fasted in case she could have the surgery. This situation was in the Easter period. Limited staff. On the third day, in my presence, a fully qualified nurse commented that my mother should not be taking up a bed, she should be at home. With a shattered elbow, and two injured knees. I had a meeting with a young registrar, who I think did not know what to do, and called in a senior registrar. I asked him what I could possibly do to rectify this awful situation. Both seemed to be extremely embarrassed, they were doing the best they could, but could not offer any advice. Again I asked for my mother to be transferred to Epworth Private, and they both told me there was no one available there to do the surgery either. In desperation, I asked the senior registrar what he would do if it was his mother, and his words will stay in my mind forever. He said â€œgo home and google a plastic surgeonâ€? I am not that young either, but I do know what Google is, and I do have a computer, but I also know that is not the way it works. Google an elbow surgeon? After spending so many days in Box Hill hospital, with so little help with food and toileting, (because nursing staff appeared to be overworked) my mother was finally taken to a city hospital, where she underwent a total elbow replacement. Followed by months of rehabilitation, and many months of follow up physio etc. None of this was organised by the health system. I called in favours. I was lucky enough to be acquainted with a plastic surgeon. He called in a favour from a colleague. I was so lucky and privileged to know someone who knew someone. I hate to think how it would have turned out had I not been able to do that. Every single part of the above can be documented if anyone cares, (oh except of course the private conversation where I was told to Google a surgeon)

Story: I have been through Royal Hobart Hospital Specialist Clinics for kidney problem and then as a day patient, in 2013. The doctors and medical intervention was first class as was follow up; and excellent after some poor private hospital experiences in years past. This greatly impressed me. I was admitted via emergency and accident on 18 Oct and then admitted into the RHH. Again I was able to feel safe and medically secure with the doctors and nursing care provided. It had been an extremely traumatic experience and the way the system worked so well it had a huge calming effect on myself. The system worked as well as could be hoped and my recovery was no doubt due to the timely medical treatment and intervention. The testing and medical systems were able to pinpoint the cause of my condition and received appropriate care and guidance for me to utilise at home upon discharge. What could have been done better? I can state that I could not see how anything could have been done better or differently.

Title: Operation efficient enough, pre and post operative visits very inefficient.

Location: Royal Hobart Hospital / Gynaecology;
Author: the patient
Story: Having had extremely heavy, constant bleeding for a couple of years, I was diagnosed with fibroids. It was suggested that I have an IUD inserted rather than a hysterectomy. Being on a low income without health insurance, I opted to have this done in the public system. The actual operation was efficiently done, but the amount of time wasted on seeing me multiple times before and after the operation, to no purpose, has been very annoying for me. My first appointment was fine; lots of information taken and details checked. I was told I would have my operation cancelled if I didn't attend another half-day clinic. I took the day off work, drove into the city, only to find that all they wanted to do was take my blood pressure and weight. I was told to bring in all my medications, to compare to the list I'd made at the first clinic. When I pointed out a medication I'd stopped taking, the nurse told me not to worry about it. So I'm not sure what was the point of checking the list? She conducted the tests in a room with the door open, so there was a constant flow of people in and out, chatting to her, ignoring me. She took my weight with my heavy boots and jacket on, and when I protested at her guess at how much they weighed, she agreed to take my word for my weight. So in the end, the only information that couldn't have been phoned in was my blood pressure, which I was battling to keep under control in compliance with the signs on the walls which warned me that they would call the police if I got angry. As for after-care, they told me to call a certain number if the post-operative bleeding went on for more than 14 days. On the 14th day of bleeding, I spent the morning on the phone, trying to find a hospital number that actually had a person available to answer, being shunted back and forward between my GP and the hospital, each of which denied responsibility for my after-care. Eventually I was told to come into Emergency, where I waited for six hours. I feel that that it must have been known that the doctor I was called in to see was operating that day, so wasn't sure why I was not told to come in at the end of the day? It seemed to me that the doctor took a quick look when he arrived at 10pm, couldn't figure out what was wrong, and told me to attend the pre-arranged post-operative clinic to figure it out. The six hours I spent reading the signs about calling the police if I got angry I feel simply emphasized that the hospital could do with the services of a time-management expert. The post-operative clinic was no better. I don't believe the doctor could imagine how annoying the glib advice is: 'Just wear pads to soak up the bleeding... every day for the rest of your life'. I'd like to see one of them put up with that regime! 10 months later, I'm still bleeding, but there's no way I am going back to the hospital to have my time wasted any further.

Story: I've been admitted to the Barrett Adolescents Center for a couple of years. For a while I went backwards because of other patients giving me negative pointers in self-harm and suicide. But as the weeks went on I started moving forward with the help of another patient; My treatment and progress went up and down, but slowing I was moving forward onto discharge. Until late last year when the government were throwing around whether they should close the Barrett Adolescent Center. Then it seemed to me that everyone lost their minds, knowing a possibility that the time with the Barrett Adolescent Center was drawing to an end. Self Harm, Suicide Attempts, Panic, Fear filled the ward for months. As time went on it kind of settled, but with some new patients to ward, which eased my mind thinking if they were still admitting people the ward mustn't be closing. At the time I was flying forward and then returning to school for 3 to 4 full days. Then came the staffing changes, a number of the staff were moving or leaving for, I think, job security. Then along came the panic again, only this time it lasted for months without end. Without the comfort of staffing that I knew and loved, left with strangers thus it seemed setting everyone off for a very long time. Then my situation changed when my friend was moved. From happy to completely distraught in a madder of seconds. I couldn't go to school, I cried my self to sleep for a week. I am forever scarred for what I feel the media, Government and other patients have done to me.

Location: Lyell McEwin Hospital;
Author: the patient
Story: I recently gave birth at the Lyell McEwin hospital, and had a very mixed experience. The good: -the first midwife I came into contact with once arriving was great. I had gotten out of the car and immediately felt the need to push, and couldn't cope with walking. She had a wheelchair out to me very quickly, and while waiting coached me to puff through contractions. -most of the midwives I had during the birth and while in Women's Health afterwards had great bedside manner. -the doctor and pediatrician at the Women's Health ward were lovely. The not so good: -when I first rang the Women's Assessment Unit, I was having contractions 5 minutes apart lasting 1 minute each, and was told to stay home, take painkillers and ring back in an hour. I believe I should have been advised to come in, and that could have saved me a lot of trouble, as by the time I got in the car an hour later to go to hospital, I was in transition. -one of the midwives in the birthing unit strapped the CTG on without telling me and without waiting until I was between contractions. She kept pushing the heartbeat monitor into my lower abdomen, which hurt a heap, and then gave me what I thought was a nasty look when I eventually told her to stop pushing on it. -I had one doctor assess my tear and start stitching me up, and another doctor finish the stitches. The first doctor seemed like she was taking a long time to assess me. The in-between: -when my tear was being assessed, the doctor noticed I was jumpy and asked if I was in pain. I said no, told her I'm a survivor of abuse and this procedure was difficult for me, but said I could push through and cope with it anyway. My husband and I both had to ask both the doctors who did the stitching to keep going when I kept having panic attacks. I'm not sure if they kept stopping because I kept moving or if it was for any other reason, but it dragged out the procedure, which left me in that panicked state a lot longer. -it would have been helpful to have a lactation consultant come visit at some point. I'm having problems latching my baby on properly, and said so to a couple of the midwives on the ward, but none could see anything wrong with the latch so said it was just the letdown causing the pain.

The surgeon set the tibia with a 4mm gap! Upon returning to my home city I went to see a local orothopaedic surgeon the same week for confirmation that the treatment was OK. He assured me that this was the case. At the 6 week x-ray no healing of the tibia had occurred & he started making comments that I may need a bone graft. A the 12 week x-ray no heal was obvious. He then recommended that the surgery be redone (move the bone together to touch) & a bone grafted from my hip & while he was at it he would redo the pin in my ankle. I then queried him about why no healing had occurred & was it because of the 4 mm gap. He then commented that yes this was the problem & that he had been concerned about the gap since the first time he saw me (12 weeks ago). I am very disappointed that I was not advised of his concern at the initial consultation as I would have had the surgery redone then. To make matters worse I ended up in hospital for 5 days, 9 weeks after the injury with 4 pulmonary embolisms that were a result of 2 undiagnosed DVT's (from the initial injury) in my calf. I am now not able to have further surgery for 3-6 months as I am on blood thinning medication. So an injury that should have been on the mend after 12 weeks is still not healed after 18 weeks & is likely to go on for at least another 4 months.

Story: A decade of eye problems/surgery with regular changes in medication and regular follow ups in outpatients every three months but this is the third time in three and a half years I have not received a letter advising my next appointment. The staff I speak with assure me each time I have an appointment I will not drop out of the system but it happens. Each time I have phoned the hospital to no avail and have had to seek an urgent review letter from my GP to prompt them into action. I believe that due to time delays caused by the second drop out I required same day laser surgery because my condition had deteriorated. I would like to know what's going wrong? The doctors mark my medical records for another appointment in 3 months time but it doesn't seem to be happening.

Author: the patient
Story: I would like to take this opportunity to formally, and sincerely thank the staff on the Midwifery Group Practice at Ipswich Hospital for the exceptional services they recently provided to my husband and I in facilitating the safe arrival of our child. Of particular note, Richard (provided my prenatal care) and Lucy (delivered baby). I have experienced birthing both intermediately (at Ipswich Hospital) and also with the MGP and I would have to say, that the model of care provided to women on MGP is second to none. The care and attention paid to each woman in all stages - prenatal, birthing and postnatally is a model that encompasses the entire care continuum and is incredibly holistic in its nature. MGP provide a very high standard of education to women and their families (one I have not experienced intermediately nor with the share care arrangement) and are strong advocates for birthing women and their wishes whilst maintaining safety and professionalism at all times. The care that is provided on the early discharge with home visits by midwives is also to be commended - it is here, that a mum can feel comfortable in her own environment whilst being supported by health professionals. There is something to be said about post-hospital care where a mum is not rushing around trying to get to an appointment, rather, where the services come to her, and where she can feel completely at peace with the fact that she is still in her PJ's at 1500 when the midwife arrives knowing that there is no judgement, just support. I can not speak highly enough of the Ipswich MGP and the services they provide, the staff that man the service nor thank them enough for the opportunity to be supported in such a personalised manner during what can only be described as one of the most important stages of our family life. Please ensure that a copy of this compliment makes its way to the staff of MGP, I feel it is important that they know the value of the incredible services they provide.

Story: There does not appear to be a system for patients to book to see a doctor at the Specialist clinics. It seems to me that too many patients are booked all at the same time which can cause waiting times to extend beyond two [2] hours and in some cases several hours. In one case (I think, because a doctor did not turn up at the clinic) I was not seen by a doctor until after 4 pm after arriving at 8: 30 am as directed by the hospital booking center. I did not see that staff advised waiting patients of the problem, and complaints from patients about waiting times were on going all day.

Story: I am in a small town with a doctors service one day per week. I find having access to a Primary Care Nurse in this area a great benefit. She has established a Well Being Group here where we can discuss health and well-being concerns with her. She acts as a type of triage - encouraging a visit to the WMO or gives explanation re concerns. Also the group brings women together - so automatic discussion takes place, and in many cases fears are allayed, and a visit to the busy EMO is not needed. Another part of the program is the formation of a Tai Chi Group for older women, plus helping to keep older women fit and also helps prevent falls. As an older woman, I find the services of our Primary Care nurse extremely valuable. She also offers advice re diet (healthy).

Story: Recently, my mother was admitted to Royal Perth Hospital for a procedure to remove a cancerous lump from her breast. At the admissions area I was told to knock on the door of the recovery room to get information about my mothers progress. A nurse told me to wait outside the recovery room and I would be informed of the outcome of the operation. During the first two hours while I waited the nurse gave me two updates. At about the third hour the Nurse in Charge came to the waiting area and said who is waiting for and called out my mother's surname. I indicated it was me and the nurse proceeded to tell me that they were waiting to find out what room my mother would be admitted to. The nurse then said is the person a male or female? I said that she was talking about my mother. The nurse made no further comment and disappeared into the recovery area. At this stage it was 6. 00 pm and there was no indication that I would get any further information. I went home and returned to the hospital the next day to find out where my mother had been admitted.

Given I had family history, went to GMF private one in Kalgoorlie and said 1 month wait - I said I couldn't afford to go to Perth and was upset something was there. The sonographer spoke to me and said we'll fit you in today. Fantastic people. What about the hundreds of people who need important x-rays, ultrasounds or mammograms at Kalgoorlie Hospital was great but it means a trip to Geraldton or Perth for an easy test. Geraldton is overflowing as well so money needs to be invested in these rural towns.

Story: I was a patient of the PA Hospital recently. I was seen in the Emergency Department and then the Eye Casualty Ward. The staff were excellent. Dr Chris and the nurse Amelia in Emergency were particularly helpful, as was Dr Jenny at the Eye Casualty ward. I heard and saw them dealing with other patients who were seemed more urgent and very unwell, and some patients who appeared to me to be downright rude. Their seemingly calm attitudes and apparent genuine care was much appreciated.

Location: The Prince Charles Hospital / Accident & emergency;
Author: a relative
Story: My partner had an accident drilling, where the drill grabbed and spun around and hit him in the nose, splitting the skin between his nose and his eye. The cut itself was minor, but of course needed to be glued, stitched or steri-stripped. We presented to our local ED as there was no GP open (Sunday 3pm). We sat in the waiting room for 90mins, offered pain relief and tissues (to clean the blood off his face as it continued to bleed). No doctor or nurse actually looked at my partner to see if in fact it did require stitching or just a bandaide. As time went on and the bleeding stopped it the wound started to come together anyway. Finally we were called into fast track. They gave him a tetanus shots, glued his face and sent us on our way. A 90min wait for a less than one minute procedure. It was not the quality of care that was the issue in this story - but the ACCESS to the care.

Title: Drum Beat for Aboriginal Women's Group with Murrumbidgee Medicare Local

Story: Kate was approached from our service to deliver 'Drum Beat' to our Aboriginal Women's Group which is run at Coo-ee Cottage in Tumut. The purpose of Kate's facilitation of this wonderful program was to engage with Aboriginal women and talk health. We sat in a circle and drummed on and off for 2hrs which the women loved. Kate had the opportunity to talk about team work, how the drumming relates to our families and our health. The women now have a greater understanding of when they are 'out of rhythm' how this impacts on their family and friends. There were lots of questions asked by the women in relation to 'exactly what does this drumming do for your health? ' Kate's response was 'it strengthens your immune system, drumming can take tension out of your body, drumming can clear your head of thoughts, it helps clear your mind' etc. I observed the ladies drumming, they were laughing and at times seemed right 'in the zone' which was wonderful to watch. Kate seems to have the ability to connect and engage with our Aboriginal community and I would love for Kate to run a workshop for our Men's Aboriginal group sometime in the near future.

Story: I recently attended the Healthy Lifestyle Program that was held in Narrandera on most days. Originally I went so that my patients could see that my patients could see that I took an active interest in what they were being referred to. I was actually very impressed so signed up for the program. As a result of this, it has made me more aware of healthier food options and I have been applying this to my daily lifestyle. I have actively lost 5 kgs and reduced my clothes size. My next challenge is to become more active and give up smoking. (Small steps - big results) without the increase in weight. Thank you for the insight to take charge and make these changes. It was very well organised and allowed people interact and share their stories. I'm feeling much better and happier for these changes.

Story: I went to the Ipswich Hospital ER on advice from my GP. I have been sick for 18 months with an unknown chronic disorder which doctors are researching as I believe it is very rare. Within the last 2 weeks I have had a turn and have, I believe, been getting sicker. So after visiting my GP for shortness of breath, pain when breathing, bad cough and couple other symptoms the GP said if I am no better go to the ER. I went up to the ER, after waiting a couple of hours to see a doctor we finally saw one and when explaining to the doctor what was going on and how I was feeling, the doctor looked at me and said to me that nothing was wrong and I should go see Mental Health as they will be the only ones able to help me. It appeared to me that the doctor refused to listen to myself or my mother when trying to explain what I have and what has been going on. We ended up walking out as I know I have a serious illness and all your doctor could say was go see Mental Health. All I wanted was to get some relief with my shortness of breath and coughing.

Time: 2013-12-19T06:41:09Z
Location: Port Lincoln Hospital;Royal Adelaide Hospital / Cardiology;
Author: a relative
Story: My 84 year old mother was a â€œfrequent visitor' to ED Port Lincoln Hospital, occasionally being admitted over the past 2 years with severe pain (l) chest pain and upper abdominal pain. Overseen by her long term GP she was flown to Adelaide for a Coronary Angiogram which revealed normal coronary arteries and no indications of heart failure or any other cardiac disorder. Once cardiac disease was ruled out, the next step was to admit her for an Endoscopy / Colonscopy with expectations of confirming abdominal hernia (causing her excruciating pain requiring regular Endone, Fentanyl patches and various analgesic agents). Seemingly nil abnormalities were diagnosed, mum could not eat, was in constant pain (as documented, I believe, daily by her carers who applied patches or lotions with no apparent affect). Subsequent arrivals in ED were met by the doctors and nurses who attended my mother with Dr. comments such as 'not you again! ' or from some of the ward nurses seeing my mother, 'C'mon.....lets get you out of bed and doing something rather than whinging in bed' etc. Eventually a newly appointed GP called in a local Physician after all these agonising years ...he took one look at her and her PMH (which seemed to not have been obviously was NEVER considered previously); organised immediate transfer to Royal Adelaide Hospital where she underwent bronchoscopy / thoracotomy and was diagnosed within 12 hours with end stage advanced mesothelioma. After enduring an unsuccessful attempt at radiotherapy and extensive pain management she was transferred to a high acuity nursing home and died within 7 weeks. Her documented PMH of Asbestos Exposure in Wittenoom Gorge 1960-2 in all medical records and various correspondence between healthcare members, was, I believe, NEVER considered.....it took the local physician 10 mins to consider this a likelihood based on her history.

Story: For two years my Mother suffered ongoing illness as, I believe, a consequence of this illness not being detected by the staff that attended my mother, at Port Lincoln Hospital, and I believe through, mistreatment and ignorance, my Mother died a painful death. We need answers why she was seemingly treated like this and why it seems her illness was not detected. I feel that she was made to feel like she was a nuisance and a whinger and so many times she phoned me crying in pain and so upset by the way she felt she was treated by both nurses and doctors who attended to her at Port Lincoln Hospital. My mother felt that the nurses who saw her were rude and abusive and she understood that they were telling her, that nothing was wrong with her and she felt that the nurses she saw treated her with anger and abuse. Meanwhile, we believe she was dying and it seemed to us that no one looked at her medical notes properly to detect the cause. I believe that the cause was written in her medical notes but it seemed that no one who attended her bothered to look! ! ! It took a new doctor what seemed about ten minutes to apparently find out the problem and send her immediately over to Adelaide on the Royal Flying Doctor service only to discover I believe, that she was near death. My mother died. How could this happen? How could, it seems, one doctor take one look at her and see what was wrong when those others that saw my mother, seemingly just called her a whinger and told her to go home. When the ambulance called to pick her up from her home, her understanding was that she was told to go back home and that nothing was wrong with her. Why?

Story: I am deeply concerned about the standard of care. A family member was admitted with a stroke. The medication she was prescribed (and also medication not prescribed) as a result of this I do not believe was in line with the Australian stroke guidelines. I felt that no reasonable explanation for this was given when this was challenged. I do not think the doctor had taken an adequate history of her previous medical conditions, which I think was relevant to the medications prescribed. Even more concerning to me was that the doctor told me that a test result was "normal" when it I do not believe it was. Also the doctor told me that another test had been done and was normal, when it I donâ€™t think it had been done at all, and was only booked (for 3 days later).

Author: the patient
Story: I fractured my spine/neck following an accident. I was released from hospital in a neck brace. When I arrived for the 6 week follow up x-rays I was booked in for a wrist x-ray and cast off. When I notified them that I have never injured my wrist in any accident and that there was never even pain there when I was checked in, the admin asked what I was there to have x-rayed. At this point I'm standing in line in the same neck brace from 6 weeks ago. I said I was there to have my neck and back x-rayed as I thought I had been booked in for from 6 weeks ago. They swiftly came back with two forms. One to get my spine x-rayed and one to get my wrist x-rayed. I just laughed and said I don't need my wrist x-rayed. The nurse then notified me that it was on my record that when I was admitted. I then explained to her and showed her my wrist movement without a cast on that my wrist had never been injured and that I have no idea where this record has come from. Within the hour the x-rays were complete and I was called into a doctor to examine the x-rays. This doctor was a different doctor to the one that had been looking after me when I was admitted and at my two week check-up, not that it bothered me who examined the x-rays. When I walked into the doctor's office the doctor looked at the file and said my name, I said 'yes', then asked 'how is the wrist? ' At that point me and my dad cracked up laughing. I'm sitting down in front of a doctor who just watched me walk into the office in a neck brace and was asked how my wrist was. I explained the situation, I don't know where there was a stuff up in communication but it appears that somewhere someone has confused neck with wrist. The xrays of my spine were then examined then the brace was removed. To be fair after all the mishaps I was in and out within an hour and a half so the service was really fast.

Title: My mother's fatal accident at Algester Lodge
Time: 2014-01-17T01:36:29Z
Location: Algester Lodge Nursing Home;
Author: a relative
Story: Our mother was admitted to a high care room at Algester Lodge (QLD) after being diagnosed with dementia, and having been assessed to be unable to return to her home by QLD Health during a stay in PA Hospital after a fall at home. In December 2013 mum fell late at night at Algester Lodge in the dining room unwitnessed by staff. Algester Lodge stated originally to us that mum fell around 10.00pm and was found by staff 15 to 20 minutes later. Algester Lodge later told us the incident was "recorded at 10.45pm". We have subsequently reviewed Queensland Ambulance records which show Algester Lodge phoned Queensland Ambulance at 11.02pm. Queensland Ambulance records show that upon arrival Queensland Ambulance officers assessed mum to be suffering "Closed Fractures" and "Suspected Spinal Cord Injury" - with Ambulance officers also noting that upon their arrival Algester Lodge staff had already tried to lift mum from the floor using a hoist causing mum to be "crying out in pain". Queensland Ambulance assessment of mum at the injury site noted an obvious likelihood of a serious pelvic/right leg fracture based on "shortening, swelling, deformity and loss of function". In subsequent discussions with Algester Lodge we were told that mum had been wandering at night for some time - yet we had never been told this was happening. The first notification we received regarding mum's fall was a phone call at 3.45am from the Emergency department at QEII Hospital - the hospital staff that contacted us seemed surprised our family had not yet been advised of mumâ€™s fall and initially asked us if we realised our mother had been in Emergency for over 4 hours? At about 7.00am the next day we received our first contact from Algester Lodge saying that there had been "an incident" the night before and that mum had fallen and hit her head, had some skin tears and had been taken to hospital by ambulance. At this point we noted to Algester Lodge that mum was at QEII in a critical condition where doctors had assessed her to have severe skull and pelvic fractures and bleeding on the brain â€“ indications were that she would likely not live through the next 24hrs. In a subsequent telephone discussion with Algester Lodge we asked why we had not been informed by them immediately at 11.00pm that mum had suffered a major injury and been sent to hospital by ambulance, and why it has taken Algester Lodge until 7.00am the next day to contact us for the first time. Algester Lodge stated that this was due to their Registered Nurse on-duty at the time of mumâ€™s accident not having been present at a previous meeting Algester Lodge had held with mumâ€™s ward staff and presumably not having been aware of the need to contact us. (Our family had only in recent weeks met with Algester Lodge specifically to remedy similar multiple failures of communication where our family had not been notified of issues and occurrences with mum at Algester Lodge â€“ our understanding of the outcome being that Algester Lodge assured us this situation had been corrected). When we suggested to Algester Lodge that any Registered Nurse surely would - beyond any other procedural requirement - immediately inform us of such a serious accident requiring ambulance and hospital - Algester Lodge stated that we needed to understand that often when their staff phoned families at late hours they suffered abuse from relatives who didn't like being disturbed. Algester Lodge seemed unable to explain how mum had wandered late at night so far from her own room to the dining room - taking her directly past the nurseâ€™s station - without being seen by any staff. Algester Lodge inferred that the nurseâ€™s station would have been staffed, but we had noted on numerous visits that this was not always the case. The delay of several hours in notifying us of mumâ€™s accident prevented any of our family from attending and comforting her ASAP. Queensland Ambulance records show that upon her transport to, and admission to Emergency at QEII Hospital mum was conscious and communicative - this being noted by hospital doctors as well. However by the time we were informed and arrived at the hospital she was unconscious, which deprived us of our last chance to speak with her in any meaningful way, or knowingly comfort her. Mum died in hospital 7 days later as, we believe, a result of the fatal injuries she suffered in this fall at Algester Lodge. In particular the issues for us with Algester Lodge we note in this case are: * Failure to notify us of mum having taken to wandering at night for some time, and what appears to be a failure to enact any control on this unsafe behaviour. * Failure to have what we believe to be adequate supervision in place to note a patient with dementia wandering far from her own room late at night - especially given her route took her directly past a nurseâ€™s station. * Failure to immediately and as we believe should be a matter of course to call Queensland Ambulance given Algester Lodge state mum was found somewhere between 10.00 and10.45pm, yet Queensland Ambulance was only phoned by Algester Lodge at 11.02pm. * Failure to enact seemingly safe medical care upon finding mum â€“ who, we believe, was clearly suffering a very serious state of multiple injury - by attempting as a seemingly first choice to lift her from the floor of the dining room using a hoist before Ambulance officers had even arrived. The state of her serious injuries was obvious to Queensland Ambulance upon their arrival. * An apparent gross failure to notify family of mumâ€™s clearly extremely serious injury until at least 8 hours later, and thereby many hours after we'd been alerted by QEII Hospital who assumed we'd already been told by Algester Lodge.

Many people are widows and isolated which has given them an outing as well as gaining knowledge. People attending can suggest need / topic for the next meeting which gives them ownership and direction. The outings are excellent for morale, interaction with people from a variety of small communities and we are able to share stories and experiences. All activites are relevant, supportive and seem important for all involved.

Story: I went to get test results today 2 months after my initial consultation which was done by a wonderful Registrar I can not fault her at all! The specialist today was so uncaring and aloof... I was basically told I was a drug addicted alcoholic hypochondriac! ! He told me I had Parkinsonism and I understood him to suggest that really there was nothing he could do about it. I don't feel he even told me what it was except it wasn't like Parkinson's disease. I feel I was basically told he couldn't help me and that was that. I reported I collapsed twice in the last month where my legs went out from under me going up stairs and getting out of the bath. The Registrar I saw two months ago was concerned about my unstable high blood pressure at my initial consultation and asked me to keep a record until my next appointment. The specialist today took my BP and said "Yeah its high but your nervous about being here" I have been on High Blood pressure Medications for the last 4yrs! ! I told him I had kept a record of my readings since my last appointment and it seemed to me that he couldn't even be bothered to look at them. At one point my BP was 169/103 and 147/99 all recorded on my BP Machine. I feel totally disgusted! I felt he didn't give a crap that I was using a walking stick and was having great difficulty sleeping because of leg cramps etc... I have Fibromyalgia and in flare and I felt he just fobbed it off! ! !

So this is just a message to the public relations person at Flinders Medical Centre...please give feedback to people that post here.

Counselling is really important to me, so that even when I have not had government funding I have tried to pay for it myself. The ATAPS has now covered the cost for some of my counselling. I am now seeing Coral and she is absolutely wonderful. This is the very first time that I feel I'm really getting results. I am over the moon with how I am getting on. I have been able to build up a trust with her and I don't want to see anyone different. Coral goes above and beyond anything that is just standard. Has even come in on weekends. I love her, she is so wonderful and we are really doing good work together. I am just a little concerned and anxious the I might not be able to see her because I can't afford the transport cost. Trainfare costs so much. But I will do everything I can to keep seeing her.

Author: a relative
Story: Further to my earlier story. https://www.patientopinion.org.au/opinions/58800 . In August, the Princess Alexandra hospitalâ€™s specialist wrote to Algester Lodge and Dadâ€™s doctor regarding the statement that Dad could not use his motorised scooter stating that he â€œregrets if this statement had been misconstrued or taken out of context and, consequently, previous arrangements with my fatherâ€™s use of the electric scooter have been affectedâ€?. It seemed to me that at no time from August 2013 did Algester Lodge or Dadâ€™s doctor (who incidentally discharged himself as Dadâ€™s doctor after the incident) try to rectify their mistake. In fact, apparently, according to the Complaints Scheme, one of Algester Lodgeâ€™s offers was to allow Dad only one more assessment on the scooter and if he failed then he would never be allowed to be retested again. Also, it seemed to me that at no time that year did Dadâ€™s physio notes indicate that Dadâ€™s mobility had declined although his mobility had been the subject of a number of specialistsâ€™ requests to the Home over a three year period requiring action. Unfortunately, late last year Dad started to lose sight of his goal to have some form of independence. On 30 December he suffered a stroke and on 5 January 2014 he passed away never having had the chance to use his scooter â€“ the scooter he arranged in October 2012.

I did pay for the service, but was only $40 out of pocket after the experience. Money well spent, rather than clog up the ED for acute cases, take hours of my time and my poor sons time, and cost the health system $$$. I would recommend this service to everyone needing to see a GP out of hours. It is a pity ACT Health didnt triage patients between services, so that patients could accurately weigh up their options and make an informed decision.

When I went to the nurses station to inform them of his passing they were sitting there gossiping and did not seem to made any attempt to check on my husband. An appalling lack of care. When I left they never even asked me who the funeral director was, or while I was there went to check that my husband had indeed passed, nor did they enquire if I was ok. The worst part was that when I got the death certificate it stated my husband died the following day, it seemed to me that they couldn't even get the date he died correct. I would never recommend this hospital to anyone. It seemed to me that the nurses I saw just do not care and seem to be only interested in gossiping at the nurses station.

Story: My mother was admitted to the hospital, seemingly very sick with pneumonia and a chest infection as well as a urinary track infection. The doctors and nurses that saw my mother in emergency were great, advised we were lucky that we had bought her in when we did as she was really sick. Mum was in the hospital for four days, still, we believe, quite ill and very weak and we understand that they decided to send her home. Seemingly, she was made to pack her own things up and walk down very long corridors to a waiting room with the nurse that was with her telling her not to stop but to keep moving. When I rang to see how she was mum informed me that she was in the waiting room waiting to be picked up, but no one, it seems, had been contacted. I arranged for my sister to go and get her a couple of hours later as she was at work and closer than me. The hospital told us that they were going to organise home assistance by sending a doctor and nurse but it doesn't seem that this happened. I have called the hospital and am waiting on a return phone call to advise what is the go. It appears to me that my Mother is still not well and we have been going over every day but it seems she is not improving. Should I readmit her, as her doctor did not even pick up that she had Pneumonia.

Story: After having a hernia operation, I was sent home to recuperate. I live alone. Because I was told not to strain or lift anything heavy, I rang nine organizations seeking help. No one could help me. So in desperation I contacted my GP who sent off a fax informing Medicare Local Metro North Brisbane of my dilemma. The very next day I had a visit from a Team care co-ordinator who was so informative, helpful and empathetic that I am now able to access domestic help for the next four weeks. I am most grateful for this as I was at my wit's end, worrying as to how I would cope alone. I cannot thank you enough for your wonderful and important service.

I have an absolutely brilliant psychologist, who, I feel, is not only empathetic but very strong and direct in keeping therapy on track. As much as I dislike the therapy, her reassurance and certainty in the type of therapy she is utilizing gives me confidence that she is the right therapist and again thanks to Brisbane MIND for enabling me to be able to see her. I have seen other psychologists in the past over quite some time and although there was some progress, I don't believe there was enough; now while seeing my new psychologist, my ways of thinking, viewing situations, dealing with situations in a practical sense are challenged to the point of almost breaking, but I see the value in the "Schema Therapy" being used and again Ibelieve that having a strong but empathetic psychologist is a true blessing. I can only hope that one day I may be in a situation to be able to be as valuable to others as my psychologist and Brisbane MIND are to me. Thank you all for being there.

Unfortunately, it seemed the staff attending me couldn't put the water jug where I could easily reach it and filled it so it was heavy. This put pressure on my other shoulder which is not too good either. No-one we saw showed my partner how to adjust and help me put on my sling, so we had trouble with this. I feel that an extra night in hospital would have also helped us get the medication right as well as being more comfortable. It was difficult trying to sleep and be comfortable in my bed at home as it is not adjustable.

Finally a nurse came and took me for pre-op procedure to a different floor where renovations were being carried and I was left there on my own for 45 minutes. A different nurse took me to the day care unit but I had to sit in the waiting room in surgery gown, as there were no beds left. I was taken to the surgery at 12.15pm, five hours of waiting time. From there things went as you would expect and the staff I saw were wonderful. I wrote a letter of complaint to the hospital and they have not even acknowledged it let alone given an explanation.

Title: Great care was shown to my father at Inverpine Retirement RSL Home.

Author: a relative
Story: My father who had Alzheimerâ€™s, was a resident for just over 18months at Inverpine, RSL Care Home at Murrumba Downs. I just wanted to thank the staff for the wonderful care given to him. He was an old Digger and the staff made sure they knew what his nickname was and called him by it, which always made him feel special. He loved the entertainment girl who would come to play mind games with all the residents. She always wore bright clothes and had a vibrant manner that seemed to spark up those around her. With his condition he was in the Secure unit and it seemed to me, whenever I was there, that all the residents were treated with respect and kindness. When my father was close to death, the home called us to ensure our family had a chance to spend time with him. My father, who seemed to be in a coma state, took a few days to die. We were able to keep a 24hr vigil with him. Even with my father in a catatonic state I did not see any lessening of care from the staff. When I arrived to keep the night vigil, my father had been washed, changed from his day clothes into pyjamas, there was soft lighting, and a CD of old time music quietly playing. Throughout the night, they would come and wash out his mouth, talking to him the whole time, taking his hands and gently clean them, always taking great care. In the morning, they would again come in, bathe him, and change him into day clothes. I am truly grateful for the care and most importantly the respect the staff at Inverpine showed to my father, and the kindness shown to us during this time. After he died, we were given all the time necessary to come to terms with the loss. The staff showed incredible sensitivity. The accommodation is basic, and almost hospital like, but my dad never care about that, what was important to him, and us, was the level of care and friendliness of the staff, and I felt those things existed in abundance. Thank you to all the staff at the secure unit of Inverpine for making an extremely difficult time less so.

The dentist however sent the assistant out of the room and while she was gone kept on examining my mouth and touching the sore gums. He indicated I would need extensive dental work, said I had gingivitis and would need to have a scale and clean before any dental work. I saw my own dentist a few days later who said the nerves would settle in their own time, I didn't have gingivitis and that a simple Colgate mouthwash, available for less than $12 would help resolve the issue.

Author: the patient
Story: Good afternoon, I was admitted to the Canberra Hospital at the end of 2012 for day surgery. I completed several forms during the extensive series of pre-operation appointments with you. Sometimes, you had me complete the same form more than once. When I questioned you, it appeared to me that you didn't know why. You seemed to repeatedly ask me for my local GP to send a copy of my records to. As I have recently moved to Canberra, I told you that I did not have a local GP. It seemed to me that you didn't seem to know what to do with that information. Finally, someone asked if they could send the records to my non-local GP. I stated on several occasions that my GP was Dr X (and provided the full address) and that I wanted a copy of all records sent to her. I signed this form. But it would appear that this never happened. In fact, when my doctor rang you to request the copy of my medical records that you promised to send to her - but you seemingly did not - it would seem you refused. I hear hospitals around Australia constantly complaining that they do not have enough resources to do their jobs. It seems to me that you could save significant amounts of time (and money) by: (1) simplifying this horribly complex process of completing the same form multiple times; and (2) automatically sending copies of records to patients and/or their nominated GPs - without the need for numerous, multiple phone calls, emails and letters. I sent an email in which I re-iterated, please send a full copy of my medical records to my GP. This email was sent early 2013. I never received a response. After numerous telephone calls to the hospital, and being transferred around the hospital, I did eventually succeed in having a copy of my medical records sent to my GP.

Story: My Mum was accepted as a resident to Bethesda, part of Mercy Aged Care Services at Nudgee. Mum is in her late 80â€™s and was very keen to maintain her independent living arrangement until the end. But, many contributing factors led her to understand she required more assistance than she was receiving under her Care Package. Sheâ€™d been wonderfully cared for by staff from Mercy Aged Care Services at home and knew if ever she required residential care, this is where she wanted to live. So, she applied to Mercy Aged Care Services and was thrilled to be offered a room in Bethesda, the new area which opened in January. Mum cannot speak highly enough of the care she has received since arriving at Bethesda. From the top level of management, to the daily care providers, Mum says theyâ€™re all wonderful. As a family member, itâ€™s been wonderful to see Mum settle so well in her new environment. This is a combination of an amazing Mum and the quality of people working at Bethesda. Bethesda, part of Mercy Aged Care Services at Nudgee, provide exemplary care to my mother. Both Mum and her family are very grateful to all involved in her care.

It seemed to me that the doctor on duty decided that it was fine and did not require an x-ray as it would come back normal. Well yesterday I decided that it was still not getting any better so went to a local doctor in Logan who sent me for an x-ray which showed a small fracture, he has referred me to the fracture clinic at Logan hospital, when I went there this morning I was sent to emergency as there was no appointment, the doctor there has put it in a half cast until the fracture centre call me with an appointment. Now I am unable to work at all and am unsure if they can even fix it as it was over 2 weeks ago, being casual this means no work no income. I would really like to know why it seems that the doctor at the Boonah hospital would not bother to x-ray to be sure? ? , I feel that if he had I would be well on the way to recovery by now. I need this sorted asap so that I can go back to work

Story: Over the years my family and I have been in these hospitals and I have praise for everyone of them. I can not understand the complaints that arise, especially those on the public system and complain about time factors. If you do not have health insurance then expect a wait, this is your choice. You are not the only person in the world for medical attention. Over the years I have had health insurance and at times I have not but I think that every time I had a medical emergency for myself, husband or child I was dealt through the public system and still received top treatment. Southport delivered my baby 34 years ago, everything smooth, despite the baby coming quicker than expected. PA Brisbane - used many times, suspected heart attack and follow up surgery all public Prince Charles - I visit this hospital yearly, ever since they inserted a pace maker at the age of 35. I was there in January 2014 and everything seems to run smoothly. They keep in touch with me and at times I have called them from Emerald and they answer my queries. Emerald Qld - My husband and I have both had procedures done and I can highly recommend them. The waiting time was approximately 3 months only. The emergency department I have visited several times and they are very understanding, caring and helpful with further assistance to help my situation. The ongoing care is amazing with specialists (of which my husband and I have seen 4 specialist) coming from all areas and the staff friendly. Keep up the good work.

Story: I have been kept in a temporary ward at Ipswich Hospital, so no tv, food choice anything. With regard to the nurses that have attended me, I have had some great nurses and some not so great. I was admitted with an undiagnosed infection after numerous tests days ago I believe that I have not seen a doctor for over 48hrs despite assurances from nurses they have contacted him. I have no idea of my condition or if there is any improvement or anything thats going on at all and yet I am supposedly a private patient....you would think a patient was entitled to some information regarding their care.

Story: I have never been able to find a doctor or medical centre where I have felt comfortable or confident going to in almost 25 years but the staff and doctors at this medical centre changed that. The doctor's are very thorough and excel in their field. The doctor in particular is so professional and has helped me with a few medical issues I have had where I have had no success at other surgeries in being diagnosed correctly. I always know that if I see her that she will cover all angles to ensure that the correct results are found. Great medical centre. Wouldn't go anywhere else and would highly recommend to anyone.

I have asked three times now. I would like the file of duties so I can determine what is reasonable for me to expect. There has been no paper work regarding this at all and my current cleaner can't seem to help. The man who comes to clean for me is ok, but there are a couple of issues that keep arising. He takes the mop and bucket into the bathroom and will fill it up with hot water and then mops the bathroom and toliet, and then just brings a wet mop, through my loungeroom, and just mops the kitchen, leaving smears. I have asked that he take the bucket to the kitchen as well, but it doesn't happen. Also, the grouting of my bathroom was looking grungy, and when I pointed this out to him, he told me it was the grouting, but the young girl who came before, cleaned it with water and vinger and it use to look wonderful. Finally, he seems to clean the hair from the drain only occasionally, 1 in 6 cleans. But as I don't know what to expect, I don't know whether I can say, 'that's not good enough'.

Story: My husband had need for a lot of dental work and due to high anxiety levels and an unfortunately developed gag reflex, needed extra help to get his needs met. John looked after him and thankfully found a way to help. In so, my husband was able to undergo an anesthetic in this local surgery and have his wisdom's out - as well as anything else desperately needed. John was so good and was able to also get, I think, fillings sorted out for him as well. We are so appreciative of this help. Also, although we were glad for the extra work we did not have the full extra cash up front. John was so very good to us and we were able to pay the rest over the following two weeks. My husband has healed well and we are so thankful that we did not have to pay to go to a hospital for it which could have meant saving for another 3 months before getting needed treatment. It is just so great for him not to be in pain anymore like he was. Thank you for taking such good care of my husband - who had never gone under an anesthetic before either.

I was treated respectfully and kindly. I think also Dr M is very talented and has almost a sixth sense kind of accuracy. Either which way I thought she was very good and very quick to catch on and to understand my situation. I am very thankful to have been treated by her as I have had experiences in health care before that have not been so good. That I live in a country where I can receive kind help in the public health system makes me very appreciative. I'd like to also mention a nurse named Stuart who has followed up with me at health centre who has a kind and friendly demeanor.

Title: My experience of mental health services has been negative, but I have found safe and trustworth help at Gnadenfrei Psychology.
Time: 2014-04-25T17:03:54Z
Location: Brisbane MIND (Metro North Brisbane);
Author: the patient
Story: From the get-go I have had only good experiences with this practice. Upon inquiring of their services a receptionist I spoke to responded efficiently via email and when I went to appointments found her welcoming and friendly always with a brilliant smile that matched. That is very comforting if you are a bit nervous to visit. Also having tea and coffee available is fabulous too. I found very supportive services such as mental health plan regimen and flexibility with appointments. Also where tight on budget, there are options to see professionals at varying levels. Brisbane MIND have supported sessions through ATAPs plan which has allowed me the more intensive help I have needed at times. This has given me so much more opportunity for improvement of my mental health than I could not have otherwise had. I believe that that kind of support network can save lives. In that, it is a powerful tool to help not only myself but many others. The Gnadenfrei Centre even has a community gardening group set up for people who want to be involved. I have had the opportunity to see a well experienced professional psychologist. I think this lady is very kind, thoughtful, attentive and very patient. This, from my experience, can be a rare find. My history with mental health services was mostly a forced treatment which made it a very negative one even though it saved my life several times. So I hated all kinds of health care, and anyone involved I considered my enemy. It took me many years to settle down this kind of negative view on health care - and especially mental health care. I prayed for years to find safe and trustworthy help that felt right and finally came across Gnadenfrei psychology. I do believe that an answer to prayer. I think one really great aspect of going to this centre is not being treated as a lesser person for believing in God, as there is an optional Christian side of counselling available there. After taking detailed history in my visits, I think my psychologist was the first mental health professional to finally give me a diagnosis that fit my experiences. I was very grateful and prayerfully sought to understand and confirm this. I have a very strong tendency for denial and so have found it difficult to help myself. My psychologist has helped me significantly to understand some of the giant mess that goes on in my head. I am so am very thankful to be able to have a diagnosis in order to tackle my problem. Part of my treatment at Gnadenfrei has been expressive therapy which has made amazing improvements to me that I have noticed straight away after even my first session. A very kind lady has then done these expressive therapies with me in between consultations with my psychologist which has given me great benefit. Also EMDR therapy has greatly improved some of my strong emotional triggers and has brought healing to broken parts of my heart. This kind of help, by these kinds of people, in this kind of environment is not only powerfully productively helping me - and no doubt others - but, I believe, it is so rare a thing to find. Gnadenfrei is like a rare jewel of a place/refuge to find help and is priceless in the ways peoples' lives can be changed. Not only that but I believe it is a place used by God like an instrument to care for others, which is the heart of God.

Story: Earlier this year my hubby found me collasped and had my son call an ambulance. He said he found me not breath and no pulse so gave me CPR. They ambulance officers were wonderful, they took me to the Ipswich Hospital. From the waiting area I was invited into the examination room. I was hooked up to an ECG machine when it happened again. I felt like I was being drained and then woke up with a room full of people wondering what had happened. Dr Jo had given me CPR. I didn't believe my husband at first when he told me this had happened at home so when it happened again whilst lying on the table, it still took a month to sink in. Basically I faint but my heart stops when I do and I need CPR to start it up again. I had scans, MRI's, xrays, visits by the lovely blood fairy - everything imaginable. They were great! The nurse caring for me, the Doctor's, Registrar, catering staff, cleaning staff - just fabulous. I would like to thank everyone. I know some of the staff's first names and am yet to complete a feedback form - but wanted to say the Ipswich Hospital's care of me was wonderful! The staff are top quality. I was meant to be transferred to Greenslopes hospital but as the computers where down, Greenslopes could not comfirm my Private Health would cover the treatment they want to give me. Almost 9 hours later they confirmed I could be transported but by then I was already in the Cardioligy Unit and it was approx 6pm so I remained in Ipswich. As the Ipswich cardioligy unit was being extended I was lucky to get a room as there were none available when I first came in. It was a little crowded by my last day transferred into a room with 3 other ladies which was a little upsetting as the lady next door decided to use the single bathroom as her own personal onsuite and was consistantly noisy and uncaring about others, but that couldn't be helped by the Hospital.

Author: the patient
Story: I got bitten badly on my index finger, after which I went to my GP, got a tetanus boost injection and some penicillin (for in case). A couple of days later, however, my finger was swollen and throbbing and an angry red colour was starting to spread down my hand. I decided to go to Geelong Emergency Department as I didn't want to loose my finger or get blood poisoning. I registered as a patient - the staff I saw were efficient and quick. They directed me as to the expected waiting time, where to wait, where the nearest toilets were etc, etc. I was seen about two hours later (not as long as I thought I would have to wait to see someone) by, I thought, a knowledgeable, kind and professional doctor who after consultation with another doctor, advised me that the best course of action would be to take an x-ray (to ensure there were no breaks), admission to hospital to do intravenous antibiotics at different intervals and to go to theatre to cut the wounds open and flush them until clean. My drip was put in immediately without the usual digging around to find a vein. The ED waiting room seemed clean and neat. My x-rays were taken without much fuss or drama. ALL the doctors and nurses I saw were friendly and forthcoming with information while maintaining a sense of humour and perfect professionalism. Even a bubble(s) in the drip line was dealt with quickly and efficiently. Once I was admitted to the hospital (there were no beds available elsewhere so I spent my time in Paediatrics - highly recommended as its colourful and you can get ice cream and jelly! ! ! ), the ward staff that saw me were friendly and the doctors still came to see me and keep me up to date. I did not want to have general anaesthetics for such a short procedure, only local and discussed it with my surgeon. I felt my opinion and choices were listened too and respected. And the stitches are neat and small - I could honestly not have asked for a more pleasant experience due to unpleasant circumstances. Well done to the ED and all surgical and nursing staff. This is almost exactly what medicine is all about. Keep up the great work.

Story: I have been attending a general practice in Inala for the last 12 months. I cannot believe the personal care and attention you receive. I feel that both the GP and the practice manager, treat you as if you are the only person they are taking care of. I have an elderly friend who also attends this practice, recently I have been worried about his health and home care. I was able to call the practice up and let them know my concerns. They maintained total confidentiality on his behalf (ie didn't release any information to me) but attended to my concerns within two days by arranging follow up for him. My own care has been extremely personal, too, with the doctor I feel taking a personal interest in my health from a holistic perspective. She seems to respect my thoughts, wishes and research and works through options with me respectfully. I think that if all our GP practices were like this, the government would need to spend a lot LESS money on picking up the pieces. Thanks to everyone at my clinic, you are really fabulous! !

Title: No responsibility by Royal Adelaide Hospital for lost property
Time: 2014-05-29T01:03:55Z
Location: Royal Adelaide Hospital / Accident & emergency;
Author: a relative
Story: Early this year (2014), my elderly father had a fall at home. As a result, he was taken by ambulance to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for treatment of suspected fractures to several ribs and vertebrae. I felt that the care and treatment he received in Emergency was prompt, professional and thorough. NB. though having to tell his story to 5-6 different health professionals was a little stressful for him and probably taking QA too far, but that's another story - an important efficiency story for our struggling hospital network! ! When it was determined at 2. 30am the next morning that my father would be admitted, I left him comfortably resting. Critical to this story, I left him with BOTH of his hearing aids in place. When my brother and I visited Dad in the ward later that day, he had only ONE of his hearing aids. We raised this with the nursing staff who were caring for my father who said that sometimes little things like that can get caught up in bed clothes and the like on transfer. They said they would conduct a search and let us know if/when the hearing aid was located. After several days, they conceded that the aid had been lost and could not be found. I then spoke with the nurse manager of the ward who indicated that he would (the next time I came in) provide me with a form to claim compensation for the loss. Despite my requests, on each subsequent visit to the ward, no form was presented. After chasing the form and the nurse manager for 2 weeks, he eventually spoke with me and said that there was no form after all and I had to contact the hospital's General Services Office about the loss. That same day, late February, I wrote to the General Services Office about the lost hearing aid. Four weeks passed and we received no contact from that Office. I then received a written reply, by letter, which I felt ostensibly shrugged off the matter in a very insulting and uncaring fashion, and seemingly with no understanding or appreciation of the Emergency Department environment and procedures or of the effect of pain relief medication on physical and cognitive function. The letter in part read "a thorough search has been conducted but nothing has been found" and "upon the investigation the CSC advised us that [my father] had no cognitive or major physical limitations limiting him from looking after his own property" and "it is hospital policy that patients and patient minders are responsible for their own belongings and the Royal Adelaide Hospital will not take responsibility for the lost hearing aid". I think this blame-shifting on to a drugged-up, frail old man is disrespectful, insulting and very poor form. That lost has ultimately cost my pensioner parents very dearly! !
